<p>As well as a spectacular show that included traditional lion dancing and musical performances from local school and college children, the annual event,&nbsp;now in its 19th year, included a business element for the first time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The event was designed to explore&nbsp;the opportunities and challenges of doing business with China.</p>

<p>Max Woodford, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's&nbsp;assistant director of regeneration and investment, gave an overview of the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000855/M00006638/AI00066106/$20180404164520_016156_0056507_GreaterBrightonTradeandInwardInvestmentStrategyFinal.pdfA.ps.pdf"">Greater Brighton&nbsp;Inward Investment &amp; Trade Strategy</a> before inviting members of the audience to&nbsp;direct their questions to a panel of business experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strategy has been developed to help the City Region realise its potential as one of the UK’s leading locations for investment and trade.</p>

<p>Panellists included Brighton &amp;&nbsp;Hove City Council chief executive&nbsp;Geoff Raw;&nbsp;John McLean OBE, chairman of several China based companies as well as&nbsp;a Vice Chairman of the Institute of Directors (IoD); Dr&nbsp;Aijuan Wang, Strategic Development Director of China at Mott MacDonald; and Xabi Izaguirre, Head of Planning at Oban International..</p>

"34826","<p>We’re exploring the best location to start restoration of the first three arches to showcase the project. These will be funded by the successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>We are continuing to assess the condition of the western-most arches. The thinking behind the proposal to restore these first is:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>They would offer easy access for all</li>
	<li>Need less ‘propping’ and ‘dismantling’ (to prevent the rest of the Terrace from collapsing and separate the unstable parts from those being restored) as these arches are at one end</li>
	<li>Being close to the Palace Pier and bus/coach drop-off points with high visitor footfall would help make the most of the showcased arches</li>
	<li>Community input is a key part of the restoration&nbsp;and <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=117&amp;MId=8153&amp;Ver=4"">the council meeting on 28 March</a> will respond to a petition asking for the work to start work further to the east of the Terrace, by Concorde 2.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Our project team is looking at this option in more detail, including how it will impact on costs and the original objectives of the crowd funding.</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee, said: “We share the community’s aim of making sure we get the final decision on location right. We are committed to working with all the Terrace’s supporters to reach our shared goal of restoring the whole of Madeira Terrace.”</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>We are looking forward to submitting a renewed funding bid to the National Heritage Lottery Fund (NHLF) in May. We recently received more information about how the future bidding process will work and how we can fit in with NHLF priorities which are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Landscapes and nature</li>
	<li>Community heritage</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Brighton &amp; Hove has the potential to make an excellent case study both for community heritage and improving the biodiversity of the seafront.</p>

<h2>New site office</h2>

<p>The project has a new site office on Madeira Drive opposite the western end of Madeira Terrace.</p>

<p>It is providing a base for community activities, a site office and space for events’ organisers which will generate revenue for the project. Brighton half marathon organisers Sussex Beacon were the first customers.</p>

<h2>Learning more about the structure&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Final year Building Surveying students from the University of Brighton are using Madeira Terrace as a case study for their work, which includes creating a basic design for a ‘pod’ that could be used for a variety of commercial and leisure activities.</p>

<p>A full annual ‘special inspection’ of the whole Terrace, commissioned by our property and design team, took place at the end of February.</p>

"33286","<p>Recent media articles have misrepresented work to tackle #periodpoverty which gained cross party support at a council committee earlier this month.&nbsp;The report does not say that boys will have periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000968/M00009226/$$Supp30547dDocPackPublic.pdf"">report put to the committee</a>&nbsp;was raised as part of the council's commitment to&nbsp;Poverty Proofing the School day.&nbsp;The seven&nbsp;page report sets out the challenges and support available for girls and young people facing issues around period poverty. The benefits of all pupils learning about periods as a way to remove stigma and confusion is a key focus of the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;report is clear about how: ""Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods"" and ""Pupils with very early onset puberty and trans pupils and students are provided&nbsp;with additional support perhaps from a school nurse, if needed."" These supporting comments are set in a much wider context and cannot be taken as&nbsp;stand alone statements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National statistics, included in the report,&nbsp;show:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>One in ten girls in the UK have been unable to afford period products</li>
	<li>49% of girls have missed an entire day of school because of their period</li>
	<li>Research also shows significant taboo and stigma surrounding periods and menstruation</li>
</ul>

<p>The debate covered&nbsp;a range of ways to&nbsp;tackle period poverty both in terms of access to products and the stigma of talking about periods among young people.</p>

<p>Councillors agreed to support the campaign by providing funding for the local Red Box project which distributes free period products to schools.&nbsp;The continuing work of the council’s PHSE (personal, sexual and health education)&nbsp;service and the school nursing service were also&nbsp;recognised as having a significant role in reducing stigma and shame related to periods and provide education on puberty and changes within the body.&nbsp;</p>

"33581","<p>Overall GCSE results in schools across Brighton &amp; Hove continue to outstrip the national average, according to newly-released government figures.</p>

<p>The city is four percentage points ahead of the national average in both the government’s key measures for English and maths combined:</p>

<ul>
	<li>68% of Brighton &amp; Hove students achieved grades 9-4 compared to the national average of 64%</li>
	<li>47% of Brighton &amp; Hove achieved grades 9-5 against a national average of 43%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most GCSEs are now being graded from 9 to 1, with 9 being the top grade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government describes a Grade 4 as a ‘standard’ pass, while a Grade 5 is a ‘strong’ pass.</p>

<p>The city is also ahead of the game for the government’s new ‘Attainment 8’ performance measure. This shows average attainment at individual schools across eight subjects.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove’s Attainment 8 figure is 48.0 compared to the national average of 46.5.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s executive director for families, children and learning, Pinaki Ghoshal, said:</p>

<p>“This year-on-year improvement comes on the back of improved results city-wide at both A-level and primary level.</p>

<p>“Hats off first and foremost to our young people and their teachers, who have worked really hard to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I think our schools team and the city’s Education Partnership also deserve credit for their continued collaboration to raise standards.</p>

<p>“This has also included an improvement city-wide in Progress 8, another key government measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phonics is a way of teaching young children to ‘decode’ letters and words, and is seen as a key strategy for helping children learn to read.&nbsp;</p>

"33521","<p>A new approach to funding community and voluntary sector partnerships in the city benefitted nearly 36,000 residents in its first year.</p>

<p>The figures come from the first evaluation of the city’s Third Sector Commissioning (TSC) programme going to next week’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities Committee.</p>

<p>Twenty-six community and voluntary sector partnerships were awarded three year grants under the TSC programme in January 2017.</p>

<p>These grant agreements end next March and we’re now seeking the go ahead to begin consultation on updating the process for grant agreements starting from April 2020.</p>

<h3>New approach to awarding grants</h3>

<p>The TSC programme is a joint initiative between the council and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was introduced to make sure grant awards deliver maximum value for money, meet community need and support the city’s community and voluntary sector effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the first year, 35,959 residents benefitted from 144,660 sessions run under the programme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secure three-year funding has allowed organisations to plan and build their capability to deliver services focussing on people with multiple and complex needs.</p>

<p>They’ve also been able to add value, with the partnerships securing a further £6.27 million in funding in contracts and additional grant applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Supporting a stronger community and voluntary sector for the city</h3>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s great to see the positive impact this new approach to funding has had on the city’s community and voluntary sector – particularly how many residents have benefitted.</p>

<p>“The stability of the funding allows the sector to connect with communities and help many people who otherwise struggle to access services.</p>

<p>“It‘s given organisations the breathing space to develop new activity and secure additional funding, which has helped provide a stronger and more sustainable sector in the city.”</p>

<p>Sally Polanski, the Deputy Chief Executive of Amaze, a charity working with families of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The third sector commission has had a huge impact on the lives of parent carers and children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s enabled the provision of information, advice and support services and short breaks to local families, which has in turn increased their confidence and resilience, and strengthened their voice to shape the decisions that affect them.”</p>

<p>The theme of Holocaust Memorial Day this year is ‘Torn from Home’, and it also marks the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda and the 40th anniversary of the end of the genocide in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said: “Holocaust Memorial Day is a time to remember the countless people affected by horrors almost beyond our comprehension.

<p>“We remember the devastated Jewish communities all across Europe, and all those destroyed by the hatred of the Holocaust. We remember the victims of genocides around the world since then. With the survivors and on behalf of the lost we say together ‘Never Again’. This and every Holocaust Memorial Day renews our commitment to end anti-Semitism and all racial and religious hate.”&nbsp;</p>

"33636","<p>A new street fundraising agreement covering responsible face-to-face fundraising in Brighton &amp; Hove comes into force today (Monday 28 January).</p>

<p>The agreement between the council, the <a href=""https://www.brilliantbrighton.com/"">Brighton City Centre Business Improvement District (BID)</a> and the <a href=""https://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/"">Institute of Fundraising (IoF)</a> covers the whole&nbsp;city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agreement limits fundraising to a number of streets in the city centre and sets controls on when fundraising can take place, the number of fundraisers in a&nbsp;location and the frequency of visits a week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of the ‘Site Management Agreement’ (SMA) is to provide a balance between the duty of charities as they raise vital funds and the rights of the public not to be put under undue pressure to give.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""/sites/default/files/final_brighton_hove_sma_january_2019.pdf"">Read the Brighton &amp; Hove Site Management Agreement in full (PDF 816KB)</a></p>

<h2>Getting the balance right</h2>

<p>The decision to review the city’s SMA was made at the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=968&amp;MId=9226&amp;Ver=4"">Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee on 3&nbsp;December 2018</a> following concerns raised about street fundraising in George Street in Hove.</p>

<p>The new agreement means no street fundraising activity will take place in George Street.</p>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the council’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Street fundraising is an important way for charities to garner support, but we’ve listened to concerns that it has caused problems in some areas. This new site management agreement will help us get the balance right across the city.&nbsp;I‘m very pleased that we’ve been able to work with the Institute of Fundraisers and the Brighton BID to move so quickly on finding a solution.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gavin Stewart, Chief Executive of the Brighton BID said:</p>

<p>“It’s great to be working closely with partners to ensure that charities have the visibility they need to raise funds, while balancing the needs of businesses and the public. We have worked with the IoF for many years now and welcome this new site management agreement, which I’m sure will deliver a better city centre experience for all involved.”</p>

<p>Alex Xavier, Director of Membership, Compliance and Professional Development at the IoF, said:</p>

<p>“I’m pleased that the IoF is working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and the city centre Business Improvement District, Brilliant Brighton &nbsp;to further improve the level of excellent fundraising in the city centre.&nbsp;Face-to-face fundraising and the work charities do to reach supporters in the Brighton &amp; Hove area is vital to raise important funds for the causes the community cares about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The fundraisers you meet on the street are there to have a personal, one-to-one conversation with members of the public to make a connection with a charitable cause. However, it’s important that these encounters are regulated and are pleasant experiences for the public.”</p>

<h2>Street fundraising conditions</h2>

<p>As well as setting controls on street fundraising, the new SMA also reiterates the <a href=""https://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/code"">Code of Fundraising Practice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-07/Street-fundraising-rulebook%20(English).pdf"">Street Fundraising Rule Book</a>, which reinforce the rules that all fundraisers in the UK should follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IoF will support their members operating in Brighton &amp; Hove through a programme of spot checks and continued co-regulation with the council partner. Breaches of the conditions of the SMA attract penalty points under our penalties and sanctions regime.<br />

"33656","<p>Field officers are out and about seven days a week across the city tackling concerns raised by residents and businesses.</p>

<drupal-entity alt=""Field officers out and about"" data-align=""right"" data-embed-button=""file_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""image:image"" data-entity-embed-display-settings=""{&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;image_link&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""abd6dc18-8d1c-4d00-a944-a0c0f103613a"" title=""Field officers out and about""></drupal-entity>

<p>The team takes council services out to local communities and every day is different, depending on what reports come in.</p>

<p>Noise prompts most complaints – whether it’s a one off event like a loud party or ongoing disturbance from noisy neighbours.</p>

<p>The field officers also respond to a wide variety of other issues, including for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bonfires</li>
	<li>Fly-tipping</li>
	<li>Barking dogs</li>
	<li>Illegal street trading</li>
	<li>Blocked drains</li>
	<li>Obstructions on pavements</li>
	<li>Motorbikes being ridden on footpaths</li>
</ul>

<p>They also help with monthly air monitoring checks at dozens of points across Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<h3>All in a day’s work</h3>

<p>Working closely with local people and problem solving is at the heart of the field officers’ work.</p>

<p>They link up with other council departments, and other organisations in the city, to get to the root of the problem and get things sorted.</p>

<p>Field officer, Teresa Reynolds, said: “There is no such thing as a typical day. We can go from serving an enforcement notice, or responding to a complaint about noise, to changing the tubes which are used to monitor air quality around the city.</p>

<p>“We need to be compassionate as well as enforcing regulations, it is a fine balance.”</p>

<p>She added: “Sometimes on a straightforward call we might discover other underlying issues. For example, a neighbour who is the subject of a noise complaint may be a vulnerable person who needs other support, and we can contact other services to help with that.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Making a difference</h3>

<p>The range of issues the team deals with is growing as the service develops and reacts to the needs of local communities.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of where their action is making a difference:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arranging for used needles and rubbish left in the street and on open ground to be removed and for cleaning to be carried out</li>
	<li>Tracking down a key holder for an empty property where an alarm had been ringing for more than 24 hours</li>
	<li>Taking enforcement action to clear large items of furniture which were blocking and creating a potential hazard for pedestrians</li>

"33666","<p>Historic Hove Museum will host the city’s next <a href=""http://www.techtakeback.co.uk/"">Tech-Takeback</a> event where people can drop off old and unwanted computers, phones and other gadgets.</p>

<p>Residents will be able to offload their unused and forgotten-about tech (working or broken) at the famous New Church Road landmark from Thursday 7 February to Saturday 9 February between 10am and 4.30pm.</p>

<h2>Tech-Takeback</h2>

<p>Tech-Takeback is a special ‘pop-up shop’ run by a team of dedicated IT and waste prevention experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can drop off unwanted tech, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PCs</li>
	<li>tablets</li>
	<li>laptops</li>
	<li>cables</li>
	<li>mobile phones</li>
	<li>hard drives</li>
	<li>USBs</li>
	<li>CDs</li>
	<li>DVDs</li>
	<li>games consoles</li>
	<li>printers</li>
	<li>digital cameras</li>
	<li>sat navs</li>
</ul>

<p>The items will then have any data erased for free by experts using a government compliant data-erasure service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pop-up shops are run by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, <a href=""https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/greencyclesussex"">Freegle</a>, the free online reuse network, circular economy environment specialists <a href=""http://www.soenecs.co.uk/"">SOENECS</a>, and computer data erasure experts <a href=""http://www.erasemydata.uk/"">EraseMyData</a>.</p>

<h2>Reused or recycled</h2>

<p>Once checked and any data is erased, the tech is given to charities to either use or distribute, given away for free on <a href=""https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/greencyclesussex"">Freegle</a>&nbsp;or to people less able to afford new tech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the equipment is beyond repair, it is dismantled, with its parts recycled.</p>

<p>A variety of local charities have benefited from Tech-Takeback, including the Sussex Homeless Support Charity, the Green Centre, The National Tech4Good Awards, The Bevy Community Pub, Artists at Boomtown Festival, Brighton Pride HQ, Screwed Sculptures, and the Library of Things.</p>

<p>We have also sent donated tech to the Little Trees Skills Training Centre in the Gambia, Africa.</p>

<h2>Saving the planet</h2>

<p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, is the fastest growing and one of the most dangerous rubbish streams affecting our planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The services Tech-Takeback provides, including giving the equipment a new lease of life or arranging responsible recycling, is a fantastic way of cutting back on e-waste pollution.</p>

<p>During the previous four Tech-Takeback events held in the city, residents have donated 6.5 tonnes, equivalent to 2000 bricks, of tech which massively helps in reducing the amount of E-waste going to landfill.</p>

<h2>The story so far</h2>

<p>Our four pop-up shops have been visited by more than 750 people and a total of 3645 items have been dropped off, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>692 mobile phones</li>
	<li>492 laptops and tablets</li>
	<li>209 computers</li>
	<li>232 hard drives</li>
	<li>276 USB memory sticks</li>
	<li>more than 350 boxes of cables</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr David Greenfield, co-founder of Tech-Takeback and managing director of SOENECS, said: “Hove Museum is a fantastic venue to hold our fifth pop-up shop.</p>

<p>“It’s the first one we’ve held in Hove so we’re hoping local residents will come out in force and drop off their old or unwanted tech.</p>

<p>“Tech-Takeback not only allows people to get rid of their old tech lying about in drawers, cupboards and lofts, when the items are dropped off, anything with data on it will be expertly and professionally wiped for free.</p>

<p>“Added to that, people will also be helping charities and others who cannot afford new tech, safe in the knowledge they are helping the planet.” &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What about businesses?</h2>

<p>Tech-Takeback is free to local residents. Businesses requiring Tech-Takeback’s data-erasure services should send an email to <a href=""mailto:techtakeback@gmail.com"">techtakeback@gmail.com</a> prior to attending.<br />

"34841","<p>Our women employees earn, on average, 7% more than men, the latest gender pay gap figures show.</p>

<p>Gender pay gap measures the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across the organisation. Our latest figures reveal that the average, or mean, gender pay gap in hourly pay is -7.3% (up from -6.03%).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mean hourly rate for women working for the council is £15.06 (up from £14.88) and for men £14.03, the same as last year.</p>

<h1>What the figures show</h1>

<p>Women make up 60% of our workforce and more women have higher paid roles in the council. Of those earning basic salaries of £30,000 or more, 64% are women, compared to 36% men.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our workforce equalities data shows women generally out-performing men in recruitment processes and being more successful in getting promoted.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2018"">Nationally the median gender pay gap </a>shows men earning 17.9% more than women, reflecting the fact that more women work in lower-paid part-time jobs.*</p>

<p>Sixty-three per cent of women work part-time in the council, compared to 29% of men. Of those earning basic salaries less than £20,000, 51% are women and 49% men.</p>

<h1>Response to the gender pay gap results</h1>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, Chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equality Committee said: “These figures help to highlight the work we are doing enabling women to develop their talents and progress within the council, but any pay gap is still inequality.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Over the next 12 months we will work to increase inclusion, equality and the diversity of our workforce. We want to position the council as a supportive and welcoming place to work for all our communities and gender forms part of our wider diversity agenda.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“As part of our staff programme ‘Our People Promise’ we are developing an action plan to better understand and address our gender pay gap and tackle areas of under-representation in the workforce.”</p>

<p>Family-friendly policies such as flexible working, career breaks, parental leave, discretionary leave and children’s vouchers have all helped to make the council an attractive place for women to work and develop a career. In 2017 98% of women returned to work following maternity leave.</p>

<h1>How we report the figures</h1>

<p>We are publishing the report to coincide with <a href=""https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Theme"">International Women’s Day</a> on <strong>8&nbsp;March</strong>. This year’s theme under the social media hashtag #BalanceforBetter is focusing on improving gender balance in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Figures shown for four pay band sections, known as quartiles, reflect the lowest paid up to the highest in Brighton &amp; Hove.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Gender pay gap in hourly pay is also calculated in the middle to produce a ‘median’ figure. In our case the median (middle) gender pay gap in hourly pay is -6.7%, again showing women earn more than men (slightly less than last year’s gap of -7.29%).&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Learn more about gender pay gap reporting</h1>

<p>The data is based on an annual ‘snapshot’ pay period of nearly 5,000 council employees (excluding school based staff) who were employed on 31 March 2018 and casuals paid during that month.</p>

<p>All employers with more than 250 employees must now publish their gender pay gap report annually. We published our gender pay gap for the first time last year.</p>

<p>Over the next year we will:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agree actions to reduce the gender pay gap<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Review potential barriers to recruitment to improve workforce diversity<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engage with community groups and schools to raise the profile of the council as a potential employer for people currently under-represented in the workforce</p>

"33326","<p>Nine out of ten people living in Brighton &amp; Hove have told researchers that they’re the most satisfied with the city as a place to live that they’ve been for five years.</p>

<p>The annual City Tracker resident satisfaction survey shows that the city’s residents are far more likely than people living elsewhere in the country to feel a sense of belonging to their local neighborhood. They also strongly believe that their community is a place where people from different backgrounds can thrive.</p>

<p>And, in contrast with the rest of the country, people living in Brighton &amp; Hove are more positive about how their local area has improved.</p>

<h2>What are people saying they like about the city?</h2>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>The city’s schools are supported by local residents, backing up Ofsted’s view that all children in the city can attend a good secondary school.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>The city’s cultural offer is also a big draw. 2018 saw the highest level of attendance at cultural events since the survey began, with the numbers of people going to libraries, museums and galleries exceeding national averages.</p>

<h3>The council</h3>

<p>More residents trust the council and believe the council acts on their concerns compared with UK residents as a whole. However, overall satisfaction with the council has dropped from last year’s five-year high which is consistent with most other councils’ results according to the <a href=""https://www.local.gov.uk/polling-resident-satisfaction-councils-october-2018"">Local Government Association’s national resident satisfaction report</a>.</p>

<h2>What needs to get better?</h2>

<p>When asked what people would change about the city, residents overwhelmingly told researchers “clean up the city” and “improve the general appearance”. Housing, homes and homelessness was second on the priority list.</p>

<h2>Council Leader’s response</h2>

<p>Speaking about the survey results Council Leader, Cllr Dan Yates, said he thought the results were understandable at a local level but were also the first real reflection of the impact of national cuts on local government funding which are being felt across the country. He said:</p>

<p>“We had one of the hottest summers on record this year, which was great for most of us, but the lack of rain meant all councils struggled to keep their streets clean. It’s completely understandable that the streets and the number of missed rubbish collections during the summer contributed to people saying they want a cleaner city.</p>

<p>“Councils have enormous responsibilities; we protect and indeed save lives every day. Much of this work goes unrecognised through our less visible services which most of us are fortunate enough not to come into contact with. Services like adult social care and child protection.</p>

<p>“I’m incredibly proud that over the last four years this council has been able to shield the city from a lot of the budget reductions. We’ve protected our most vulnerable residents but it has come at a cost, and sadly most of us can now see the impact of the savings on our more visible services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“However I’m not in public office to simply manage decline. We’re developing innovative approaches to delivering services and we’re seeing improvements and differences being made to people’s lives every day. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“For example; the new Field Officer Team, bringing council services out to the city’s communities, seven days a week using mobile technology to report and quickly sort issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“And the actions and initiatives taking place through the City Environment Modernisation Programme which sees more support for the waste and recycling service and the launch of new systems and processes to enable customers to contact Cityclean effortlessly and for staff to respond quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>“Our new approach to graffiti will also start making a real difference to the city’s appearance too.”</p>

<h2>What is the City Tracker Survey?</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.bhconnected.org.uk/"">Brighton &amp; Hove Connected</a> - the city’s Local Strategic Partnership - commissioned Infocorp Ltd to carry out the 2018 annual City Tracker survey of the city’s residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survey took place from 17 September to 9 November 2018. It covers Brighton &amp; Hove’s adult population aged 18 and above and its objective is to find out what residents think of Brighton &amp; Hove as a place to live.</p>

<p>Cllr Dan Yates, leader of the council, said: “We knew when we took over responsibility for the council that there were tough times ahead. Over the last four years we’ve taken the difficult decisions required to make sure we have protected services for the most vulnerable in the city.</p>

<p>“These proposals reflect a clear grasp of the financial situation combined with a determination to reinvest in key services. It’s an ongoing challenge to meet increasing demand for services as costs rise and funding falls.”</p>

<h3>Background to the budget 2019/20</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The budget proposals for 2019/20 are the final stage in our four year budget plan.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Total savings of around £69 million will have been delivered over the four year period to provide the necessary re-investment in services alongside taxation increases.</li>
	<li>Budget Proposals for 2019/20 include:</li>
	<li>The proposals include recommendations to invest in priority services, including adult social care, children’s social care and other services to combat inequality.</li>
	<li>Children’s Social Care: A total of £54million&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adult Social Care including Learning Disability Services: A total of £92.6million</li>
	<li>Field Officer Service, providing help across the city: A total of £312,000</li>
	<li>Homelessness and rough sleeping services: For the year ahead £10.6million is proposed for these services. This includes £250,000 for an all year round night shelter for rough sleepers and £250,000 to expand options to support people in emergency and temporary accommodation.&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Council tax</h3>

<p>In common with many local authorities, the budget proposals for 2019/20 require an increase of council tax contributions to&nbsp;the council of 2.99%, largely in light of the increasing demand for social care and reducing grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This would mean the average Band D Council Tax contribution to the council would rise by £46.38 to £1,595.45 in 2019/20.<br />
<br />
The full amount for the average Band D Council tax for 2019/20 will be £1,879.03 (a rise of £73.05 from the year before). This includes £189.91&nbsp;for the Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner and £ 93.67 for the East Sussex Fire Authority.</p>

<p>The current political leadership arrangements continue for now.

Councillors decide whether and at which meeting the business is discussed.</p>

<p>Subject to the will of councillors, the day to day operation of services to the public will remain unchanged in the short term. Council officers will continue to use their delegated powers to ensure a consistent service.</p>

"34786","<h2>Top facts</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The Brighton &amp; Hove City Council budget for 2019/20 has been set</li>
	<li>Councillors decided how to allocate more than £900million&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The budget includes an increase of the council’s element of council tax of 2.99 per cent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Priorities</h2>

<p>The Brighton &amp; Hove City Council budget for 2019/20 has been set at Budget Council today (Thursday 28 February).</p>

<p>The council provides more than 700 services residents see or use every day. It currently costs just under £2.1 million to run our council services every day.</p>

<p><strong>This budget has prioritised:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Children’s Services: A total of £54million, including £46.2m for children’s social care&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adult Social Care including Learning Disability Services: A total of £92.6million</li>
	<li>Field Officer Service, providing help across the city: A total of £312,000</li>
	<li>Homelessness and rough sleeping services: A total of £10.6million for these services, including £250,000 for an all year round night shelter for rough sleepers and £250,000 to expand options to support people in emergency and temporary accommodation</li>
	<li>Cityclean refuse and recycling: A total of £27.7million, with more than £1 million allocated for specific support within the service in the year ahead&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Cllr Dan Yates, leader of the council, said: “This is a difficult time for local government in the face of ongoing cuts from central government. Since 2010 more than £100 million has been removed from the core government grants for our council.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We knew when we took administration of the council that there were tough times ahead. Over the last four years we’ve taken the difficult decisions required to make sure we have protected services for the most vulnerable in the city. It’s an ongoing challenge to meet increasing demand for services as costs rise and funding falls.</p>

<p>“This is a time to look forwards to the future and continue with the vital work of protecting services for all residents.”</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>

<p>While there is much debate about amendments to the main budget, the proposed permanent budget amendments combined amounted to just 0.2% of the Gross General Fund budget (£1.451m out of a total £761.647m).</p>

<p>On the night, following debate and an adjournment, the amendments were revised. New&nbsp;versions were&nbsp;put forward for councillors to vote on. These revised versions passed with Labour Group and Green Group support. &nbsp;The budget as amended was then put to the vote and passed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Council tax</h2>

<p>In common with many local authorities, the budget includes an increase of council tax of 2.99%, largely in light of the increasing demand for social care and reducing grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means the average Band D Council Tax contribution to the council would rise by £46.38 to £1,595.45 in 2019/20.</p>

<p>“Last year’s crowd funding campaign expressed the public’s desire to restore the Madeira Terrace to their former glory and we will continue to work hard to achieve this.</p>

<p>“Even without this funding, we are still going to restore the crowdfunded three arches and explore all avenues of funding to secure the future of the historic terraces.”</p>

"33311","<p>Work is now well underway to re-build the Shelter Hall on Brighton &amp; Hove’s seafront.</p>

<p>After two years of work to demolish the original building, strengthen the historic Kings Road arches, support the upper promenade and prevent the seafront road from collapse, the new Shelter Hall is emerging from behind the hoardings.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/joo9S6wJn24?rel=0"" width=""380""></iframe></p>

<h2>A new venue for our world famous seafront</h2>

<p>The Hall is larger than the previous building, with two internal floors, a rotunda on top and a roof terrace. The building will also incorporate new public toilets.</p>

<p>The multi million pound project is part of the council’s Seafront Investment Programme and is being funded from government grants including a £9 million investment award from the Department for Transport’s Highways Maintenance Challenge Fund, borrowing and council money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Shelter Hall will provide a fantastic new restaurant and venue for the city, with its mezzanine floor, terrace and stunning seafront views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rotunda and roof terrace on the upper prom will house a new café.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The public toilets will be located on the lower promenade, where a new walkway and seafront wall has already been created. The busy West Street junction is also being remodelled to help people and traffic flow more smoothly.</p>

<p>Expressions of interest in the two new business premises can be submitted from February next year.</p>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee said: “Following two years of extensive and complex engineering work to strengthen the seafront road and stabilise the ground, it’s exciting to see the new Shelter Hall taking shape.</p>

<p>“The Hall and Rotunda will be fantastic additions to our world famous seafront which already attracts millions of visitors each year.”</p>

"33596","<p>Crest Nicholson has told Brighton &amp; Hove City Council that in the absence of an agreed Brexit deal by Government, it cannot proceed to sign the development agreement for the King Alfred project within the current proposed timeframe.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reaffirming its commitment to enter into the development agreement and to deliver the project, Crest Nicholson said it could only fully do this once a Brexit deal has been confirmed by Government and a known exit strategy is in place.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Speaking after the meeting of the council’s Policy, Resources and Growth Committee, Thursday, 24 January, where Crest Nicholson’s concerns about Brexit were discussed, Leader of the Council Dan Yates said that the council was left with no other choice but to give Crest Nicholson a final deadline. He said:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Whilst we recognise and have sympathy with the uncertainty that Brexit brings and how challenging this is for developers who are making investment decisions, we have to see progress on the delivery of a new leisure centre complex. The council - and the people of Brighton &amp; Hove - must have serious and absolute commitment to this scheme.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The council’s Policy, Resources and Growth Committee unanimously voted to give Crest Nicholson a final deadline of 30 March to enter a development agreement but to still work towards completing the agreement by the end of January. If the original deadline is not met then the council will begin to explore other options alongside working with Crest to conclude an agreement by the end of March.</p>

"33751","<p>On 6 February the planning committee was ‘minded to grant’ permission to build 71 bed and study spaces in a four storey building on land at 41 and 42 Park Wall Farm cottages. The site is close to university campuses on the south side of the A27.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p><br />
There are currently two unoccupied semi-detached flint cottages on the site. They are now in a dilapidated state and have been empty and unmaintained for some years. A request was made to Historic England in January last year to add the buildings to the ‘List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest’ but they were not recommended for listing.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Transport links are exceptionally good for the location, with the train station adjacent, the nearest bus stop two minutes’ walk away and university campuses within walking distance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This is a good use of space and will add to the stock of purpose-built student accommodation close to where it is needed. This in turn helps to relieve pressure on houses in the city that could be occupied by families being turned into HMOs (houses in multiple occupation).”</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Planners worked with applicant Teckton Student Living on a revised scheme (the original proposed a larger building with 90 bedrooms) and the developer will contribute more than £85,000 towards open space. The plans will also include retention of two existing mature trees, a Wych elm and sycamore, as well as hedgerows.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The roof of the new building will be able to take mounted solar technologies and the site will have storage for 56 cycles.&nbsp;<br />

"33756","<p>An appeal against a planning enforcement notice for converting a small HMO without permission has been dismissed by the government’s planning inspector.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The enforcement notice was issued on 15 March last year for 249 Queens Park Road in Brighton. The owner had changed its use from a small house in multiple occupation (HMO) to a large HMO.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Retrospective planning permission for the eight-bedroomed HMO was refused. An appeal against the refusal was also dismissed in February 2018. At the time the planning inspector said the development provided unacceptable living conditions, particularly in the basement where there was a lack of natural light.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A planning enforcement notice was issued in March 2018 and this was the subject of the most recent appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Planning policy and HMOs</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This was clearly not acceptable. Our planning policies help achieve a balance between HMOs and other types of accommodation and support decent living conditions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Queens Park Road is an area where there is already a high concentration of HMOs which can have a negative impact on the environment. The inspector commented that we had good reason to refuse planning permission.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Planning inspector Graham Self noted, ‘there is a legitimate public interest in trying to maintain a reasonably good standard of residential environment in dwellings in Brighton.’&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The owner has five months to convert the property back to a smaller HMO (maximum six bedrooms).<br />

"34286","<p>We’re inviting residents, businesses, community organisations and landowners to give their views on future development of the Conway Street Industrial Area in Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-policy/conway-street-masterplan"">Take part in the consultation</a></p>

<p>Following this initial consultation, which runs until <strong>7 April</strong>, your comments will feed into a ‘masterplan’ for the site which will help guide future development. Conway Street, near Hove Station, is one of the areas identified in our City Plan for new housing and employment space.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The masterplan will help deliver new homes and jobs in central Hove. &nbsp;The project was awarded a £70,000 One Public Estate grant from central government so that partners can work together with the community to make sure that the future use of the site will benefit the city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We will be working with the Hove Station Neighbourhood Forum, developers, businesses and the community on the masterplan.</p>

<h2>Conway Street Industrial Area</h2>

<p>The Conway Street industrial area is made up of a mixture of buildings and roads close to Hove Station, with the railway line to the north, Ellen Street to the south and Ethel Street to the east.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Existing commercial properties include offices, warehouses, distribution centres, some research and development companies and various industrial buildings mostly&nbsp;dating from the 1960s.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The main depot and administrative offices for Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company is in the area, as is the car park for Hove Station.</p>

<p>It also includes land at 1-3 Ellen Street, proposed for residential and commercial mixed-use development by Matsim Properties Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hove Gardens scheme is an £80 million development of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>186 flats</li>
	<li>1,317 square metres of office space</li>
	<li>228 square metres of retail</li>
</ul>

<p>The development proposal was granted planning permission on appeal by the Planning Inspector in January 2019 and will be taken into consideration as part of the wider masterplan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is a masterplan?</h2>

<p>The masterplan will be a <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spd"">Supplementary Planning Document</a> that will provide a more detailed level of guidance to existing City Plan policies. It will help guide developers, planning officers and councillors on the best development uses for the site.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s ‘Shared Lives’ scheme is looking for more carers.</p>

<p>Shared Lives is a way to support adults who are unable to live independently. The scheme places adults with carers who offer accommodation, care and support in their own home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some carers do it on a full-time, others on a short-breaks or sessional basis. It is similar to fostering.</p>

<p class=""responsive-container""><iframe class=""responsive-embed"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvIe1o1U5P8?cc_load_policy=1"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>Shared Lives carer Lyn has Celia living with her. Lyn said: “Being a Shared Lives carer is a great way of life.</p>

<p>“When someone has lived with you and your family and had some stability you can really see them grow as people. That’s incredibly rewarding.”</p>

<p>Lyn gives Celia the day to day support she needs while enabling her to live with a great deal of independence.</p>

<p>Celia said: “I'm very happy living here. It's nice to have my independence, and also, it's very nice to have a lovely home to come to.”</p>

<p>All kinds of people can be Shared Lives carers: couples or singles, with or without children, home owners or tenants.</p>

<p>Full training and support are provided. You are paid based on the needs of each person you support.</p>

<h2>Our top tips for preparing festive food</h2>

<h3>Put raw and ready-to-eat food in separate shopping bags</h3>

<p>Take enough bags so you can separate your Christmas food shop. This helps avoid the risk of raw food contaminating other items.</p>

<h3>Make sure your turkey is completely defrosted&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If you buy a frozen turkey, check the packaging to see how long it needs to defrost – it could take as long as four days.</p>

<h3>Don’t wash raw turkey</h3>

<p>It just splashes germs onto your hands, clothes, utensils and worktops.</p>

<h3>Make sure the meat is completely cooked</h3>

<p>Work out the cooking time for your turkey by checking instructions on the packaging. Check the meat is steaming hot throughout, there is no pink meat visible when you cut into the thickest part, and the meat juices run clear.</p>

<h3>Using up leftovers</h3>

<p>Whether you cooked your turkey from fresh or frozen, leftovers can be used to make a new meal, like turkey curry. This new meal can be frozen, but make sure you only reheat it once.</p>

"33321","<p>Seafront Officers are urging residents and visitors to stay safe and keep away from the sea this winter.</p>

<p>The warning comes as the Christmas holiday season approaches and the mild winter weather draws more people onto the beaches.</p>

<p>“Everyone enjoys a bracing stroll on the promenade over the festive season but we would urge people to stay on the path or high up on the beach, especially when the sea conditions are rough,” said Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Seafront Manager Chris Ingall.</p>

<h2>Hidden dangers</h2>

<p>Chris explained how the beach at Brighton &amp; Hove differs from other south coast beaches and has hidden dangers.</p>

<p>“Unlike many other beaches, where you can gradually enter the water, Brighton &amp; Hove beach has a steep shingle slope making it difficult to leave and enter the water especially during the four hours over the high tide period,” he said.</p>

<p>“The combination of winds coming in from multiple directions and steep shingle banks increases the risk of being swept out to sea.”</p>

<p>Parents are urged to keep a close eye on children, holding their hands when on the beach and stopping them from playing ‘chicken’ with the surf washing up the beach.</p>

<p>Dog owners are also being advised to keep their pets on leads and away from the shoreline in rough sea conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>No Christmas Day swim</h2>

<p>The council will once again be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing access to the beaches around Brighton Pier.</p>

<p>“As open water swimming has become more popular over the last few years, we are seeing more groups of swimmers gathering for winter swim sessions,” said Chris.</p>

<p>“It is extremely important that those wishing to enjoy this invigorating and extreme form of free and healthy activity, fully understand the real dangers involved.</p>

<p>“Cold water sea swimming takes skill, stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced, using suitable wetsuits, in very calm conditions and with friends. Even on a calm day sea currents, unpredictable waves or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning. Even experienced swimmers can get caught out.</p>

<p>“Check the conditions on the day and consider all those in the group, the sea will be there tomorrow, don’t take unnecessary risks, that could threaten your life or others trying to help!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chris added that the seafront team is always happy to advise swimmers on sea conditions. “We have constant updates on the weather conditions and would urge anyone wondering whether it’s safe to swim to ask us first.”</p>

<p>The seafront office 2019 tide timetables for the Brighton &amp; Hove beaches should be available shortly. Information within the booklet also includes a map showing lifeguard stations and a list of seafront events.</p>

"34076","<p>It can be difficult to talk to teenagers about the harm caused by cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are a parent or carer and are having trouble discussing this with your teenagers, have a <a href=""https://www.wheretogofor.co.uk/LetsTalk"">look at the Keep Calm and Talk website</a> for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>advice on&nbsp;starting the conversation</li>
	<li>facts on smoking, drinking and drugs</li>
	<li>information about where to get support locally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting the conversation</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Choose your moment</li>
	<li>Recognise young people's knowledge and understanding</li>
	<li>Keep it real</li>
	<li>It's not what you say, it's how you say it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're feeling tongue-tied,&nbsp;try&nbsp;a few&nbsp;conversation starters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘I need you to help me understand what’s going on as I’m worried.’</li>
	<li>‘Can you try and tell me what’s going on?’</li>
	<li>‘Would you know what to do if you or your friend has taken something and seems unwell?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Facts on smoking, drinking and drugs</h2>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove has some of the highest rates of cannabis use, smoking and alcohol consumption among young people in the country. According to the What about YOUth survey from 2015:</p>

<ul>
	<li>15% of 15 year olds in Brighton &amp; Hove currently smoke, which is the highest rate in England.</li>
	<li>Almost a quarter (24%) have tried smoking cannabis and 14% have smoked cannabis within the last month - the highest rates in the country.</li>
	<li>11% of 15 year olds drink at least once a week, the joint third highest rate in England.</li>
	<li>Engaging in harmful behaviours can have knock-on consequences now and in later life, with some young people at risk of developing severe and enduring substance misuse problems that continue into adulthood.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find out more and get support locally</h2>

<p>Developed alongside <a href=""https://www.ymcadlg.org/support-advice/right-here/"">YMCA Right Here</a>, we've put together advice, support and information for parents and carers to use to help start the conversation and to help challenge widespread misinformation and myths.</p>

<p>Keep Calm and Talk came from listening to the views, experiences and needs of parents and carer’s and their young people. It aims to encourage thoughtful conversations, increase knowledge and understanding and to support changes in behaviours.</p>

"33021","<p>Proposals to build 57 new council homes could get the go ahead at the Housing &amp; New Homes committee next week.</p>

<p>If approved, work will proceed on plans to build 45 homes on the site of the former housing office and adjacent bowls club in Victoria Road, Portslade, and 12 more on a site of under-used garages in Buckley Close, Hove.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""imageRight"" data-delta=""1"" data-fid=""1002211"" data-media-element=""1"" src=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Victoria-Road-sketch-web.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" /></p>

<p>The schemes are the latest developments in the council’s New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme building new rented council homes. So far, we’ve built 173 new homes on empty or under-used council-owned sites across the city, with many more in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The preferred option for Victoria Road (sketch shown right) would provide a mix of one, two and three bedroom flats, alongside two four bedroom maisonettes and four three bedroom houses. Including the car park, bowls club house and bowling greens within the development increases the number of homes in the scheme from 15 to 45, and facilitates building a new bowling green in Victoria Rec for the Portslade Bowls Club and a new sports pavilion for the use of the bowls club and local football clubs.</p>

<p>The proposals for Buckley Close are for 12 one and two-bedroom flats, including one fully wheelchair accessible flat with a level access shower, adjustable kitchen and storage for electric wheelchairs built in. The designs include 11 off-street parking spaces, and one disabled bay.</p>

<p>The committee will also be looking at an update on the wider raft of work being done to deliver new low cost housing across the city, and plans to expand and speed up this&nbsp;work following the government’s recent announcement on lifting the housing borrowing cap.</p>

<p>In addition to the New Homes for Neighbourhood programme, work includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/node/1969851"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> partnership with Hyde, aiming to build 1,000 new lower cost homes for rent and sale in the city. Proposals for the first sites are underway in Clarendon Place, Portslade, and two urban fringe sites identified for housing in the City Plan in Coldean Lane and north-west of Whitehawk.</li>
	<li>The Hidden Homes project refurbishing and converting under-used and unused spaces in our housing buildings into new homes. Nine new homes have been completed so far, with a further six due to be ready this financial year and around 30 more in the pipeline.</li>
	<li>The<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/node/1970246""> Home Purchase Policy</a>, introduced last year, which allows the council to buy back homes sold under the right to buy. Nine homes have been bought back into the council housing stock to date and the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee recently agreed to extend the scheme to include the option of buying affordable housing units supplied as part of new housing developments in the city.</li>
</ul>

<p>Councillor Anne Meadows, chair of the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee, said: “It’s great to see more new council homes on the way through our New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme. Each site throws up a unique set of challenges and both of these schemes make brilliant use of underused space. I’m particularly pleased that we’ve been able to come up with a scheme at Victoria Road which not only provides 45 new council homes, but also allows us to improve sports facilities&nbsp;for the wider community.</p>

<p>“I’m really proud of all the work we are doing to provide much needed new low cost homes in the city. With so many people on the joint housing register, 2,000 households in temporary accommodation and rising homelessness, it is a key priority for us.</p>

<p>“The lifting of the Housing Revenue Account borrowing cap is something we’ve been pushing hard for in Brighton &amp; Hove and we’re keen to make sure it can help us expand and speed up our work to provide new homes.”</p>

<h2>Campaign aims &nbsp;</h2>

<h3>Raise awareness of help for rough sleepers to move away from the streets</h3>

<p>Charities and support agencies are helping homeless people every day of the year 24 hours a day. Outreach workers are in regular contact with people on the street, caring for their practical needs (such as food and clothing) as well as providing them with support to help rebuild their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More details are on support available is on the charities’ websites and the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/homelessness-and-rough-sleepers/how-we-help-rough-sleepers-city"">council’s website</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Asking residents to say where they’ve seen those in need so tailored help can be offered</h3>

<p>If you’re concerned about someone who is rough sleeping, please contact&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.streetlink.org.uk/"">Streetlink</a>&nbsp;and share information which will be passed to an outreach worker. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Suggesting an alternative giving option to donating on the street</h3>

<p>This is a generous city and people have many choices on how to give to those in need. Make Change Count asks people to consider donating to charities instead of on the street. The funds donated to charities are used to give tailored help that meets people’s individual needs, sometimes over a period of time to help rebuild lives.&nbsp;More than £19,000 has been donated and will be used to help people in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's quick and easy to <a href=""https://www.justgiving.com/campaigns/charity/brightonhousingtrust/mcc18"">donate&nbsp;to Make Change Count online</a>&nbsp;or you can text UMCC18 £3, £5, £10 or £20 to 70070. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Making a difference</h2>

<p>Frances Duncan, Chief Executive, The Clock Tower Sanctuary, said: “We are very grateful to everyone who has donated to the Make Change Count campaign. As the only day centre in Brighton &amp; Hove for 16 to 25 year olds who are homeless or insecurely housed, the funding will help to provide a vital lifeline for vulnerable young people at this difficult time of year.”</p>

<p>Alison Marino, Executive Director, Sussex Nightstop, said: “Across 2018 Sussex Nightstop has arranged nearly 200 safe bed nights for young people at risk of homelessness. These young people are able to focus their energies on securing suitable long-term accommodation from where they can make the most of life’s opportunities. We are very appreciative of the generosity people show through Make Change Count.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Noeleen Anstee, fundraising manager, Brighton YMCA, said: “Your generosity and kindness through donating to the Make Change Count Campaign this festive season will enable people who are homeless across our city to have a brighter start in 2019.”</p>

<p>Steve Brunton, Antifreeze Manager, said: “Antifreeze (Off The Fence) are immensely grateful for your donations.&nbsp;They help enable us to serve the street community in many ways including our evening outreaches and our warm Day Centre where we meet multiple needs.”</p>

<h3>Where the money goes</h3>

<p>All money donated will be shared between the organising charities and will go directly to people who are sleeping rough. Contributions will be used to provide food, access to shower facilities, healthcare, clothing and support from outreach workers to move people away from the street as well as a wide range of practical help to suit individual needs. No funds raised will be used for administration of the charities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Make Change Count is supported by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner.</p>

<p>Councillor Clare Moonan, lead councillor for rough sleeping, said: “We recognise the vital contribution made by local charities and support agencies across the city, there are so many people involved with this important work. There’s no doubt there is an ongoing housing crisis which we are seeing on the streets. By working together we are making a difference and the council fully supports Make Change Count.”</p>

<h2>Practical help</h2>

<p>Charities and support agencies are helping homeless people every day of the year 24 hours a day. Outreach workers are in regular contact with people on the street, caring for their practical needs (such as food and clothing) as well as providing them with support to help rebuild their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People who are rough sleeping need help to rebuild their lives and support to move away from the dangerous existence of living on the streets. The best chance for anyone who is rough sleeping to get off the street is with professional help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More details are on support available is on the charities’ websites and the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/homelessness-and-rough-sleepers/how-we-help-rough-sleepers-city"">council’s website</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Donating to Make Change Count</h2>

<p>This is a generous city and people have many choices on how to give to those in need. Make Change Count asks people to consider donating to charities instead of on the street.&nbsp;</p>

"33511","<p>A new online reporting system is being developed to make it easier for people to report problems with poorly managed and maintained private rented housing in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>The move comes after the council successfully bid for £34,820 of government money to pay for the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new system will enable tenants experiencing problems with their home to request help, provide detailed information and upload photographs to highlight concerns.</p>

<p>Council staff can then quickly make a full assessment and target enforcement action to tackle problems, such as disrepair, safety concerns, damp, and excess cold, more effectively and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Improving private rented homes</h3>

<p>Almost a third of homes in Brighton &amp; Hove are privately rented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, the council’s lead member for Private Rented Sector on the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee, said: “There are a lot of responsible landlords in the city, but we also know that many tenants are living in poor condition properties that are not properly maintained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This new initiative will enable us to build on work we are already carrying out to protect tenants and improve the standard of private accommodation in the city.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new online reporting form is due to be introduced in April.</p>

<p>Funding is from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s Rogue Landlord Enforcement Grant Fund.</p>

"33526","<p>Residents’ concerns about high concentrations of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have led to a proposal to extend the current planning rules across the city.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In most of Brighton &amp; Hove, property owners wishing to convert a family house into a shared house or HMO for up to six people do not have to get planning permission. Larger HMOs of seven or more occupants already need planning permission.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Six years ago we&nbsp;introduced controls in five wards through an ‘Article 4 Direction’ which means that in those areas small HMO conversions need planning permission.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In June 2018, the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=969&amp;MId=9190"">Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee</a> decided that we&nbsp;should look to see if there is evidence for extending the boundary of the Article 4 Direction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During the autumn, we&nbsp;gathered information of where HMOs are, discovering that although most are within the wards covered by the existing Article 4 Direction, there are also some significant numbers outside these areas in other parts of the city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Areas with high concentrations where the need to obtain planning permission does not currently apply include parts of Preston Park, East Brighton and Regency ward areas.</p>

<h2>What is proposed</h2>

<p>The proposal aims to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make the rules consistent for everyone</li>
	<li>provide long-term certainty for developers and residents</li>
	<li>prevent concentrations getting too high before action is taken</li>
</ul>

<p>It would also bring the planning regulations in line with HMO licensing which is already in force citywide.</p>

<p>At their meeting on 17&nbsp;January&nbsp;councillors decided to go ahead and open up the proposal to public consultation. Any representations made must be taken into account when considering whether to confirm the direction. The Secretary of State has to be informed of our&nbsp;decision and may cancel the Direction if it is not justified by evidence.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, lead member for planning, said: “The cost of housing in the city and overall shortage of new housing means that many young professionals and people on low incomes live in HMOs and they are in high demand, but high concentrations of HMOs can put extra pressure on communities and residents are concerned.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“This proposal is not intended to stop HMO development but give the public more say in managing change of use applications through the planning process to ensure a more even spread in neighbourhoods.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />

	<li>A new phone number is available directly to the shelter when it is open</li>
	<li>Outreach workers help people who are rough sleeping all year round and let them know when the shelter is open &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>A number to call</h2>

<p>You can now contact the SWEP (severe weather emergency protocol) team directly if you’re worried about someone bedding down on the streets when the overnight cold weather shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From tonight (Thursday 24 January), the SWEP team can be reached on 07895 407168 from 7pm on the nights when the shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SWEP shelter opens during extreme cold weather for anyone who is rough sleeping. The shelter provides an evening meal, a place to stay and bedding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Outreach workers go out and about during the day before SWEP opens to let people know the shelter will be available that night. Details of<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/homelessness-and-rough-sleepers/how-we-help-rough-sleepers-city""> when SWEP is open are also posted on our 'how we help rough sleepers' webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Central location</h2>

<p>SWEP’s main base is at Wagner Hall on West Street from 7pm to 8am (when day services open).</p>

<p>Sometimes people choose not to go into the shelter at 7pm and can be out on the streets much later in the evening. People on the street are made aware shelter is available but no one has to take up the offer.</p>

<h2>New contact number</h2>

<p>The SWEP team can be reached on 07895 407168 from 7pm on the nights when the shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can speak with one of the SWEP team to ask questions about the shelter and be given reassurance places are available if people are in doubt about whether they can go in. You can also share a location and description of someone you’re concerned about. Outreach workers will be able to check if help has already been offered. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you reach the voicemail please leave information about who needs helping. You might not receive a reply if the service is very busy but the phone with be checked regularly for messages. Please note, this is not an emergency line and if you’re concerned for someone’s safety or health call the emergency services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Clare Moonan said: “We’ve set up the telephone link to make sure concerns can be raised as quickly as possible. We also encourage people to call the Streetlink service with information which will also be passed on to outreach workers at times when SWEP is not open. We to make sure as many people as possible can come in from the cold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“SWEP is part of a range of rough sleeping services, including a winter night shelter for up to 30 people running until March and a hub where up to 17 people have their needs assessed to help them move away from the streets. We’re working together with our partners to make a real difference for those in need.”</p>

<h2>Open more this winter</h2>

<p>The trigger for opening the SWEP shelter is when a 'feels like 0 degrees'&nbsp;temperature is forecast by the Met Office and also takes into account windchill. The trigger for opening SWEP in Brighton &amp; Hove is one of the lowest in the country.</p>

<p>At this point last year the shelter had opened only 12 times during the same period. So far this winter, SWEP has been open for 20 nights. The first time the shelter opened this winter was on 12 December 2018. The difference is because the trigger for opening was previously higher so the shelter met the criteria for opening less frequently. The current “feels like 0 degrees” trigger was introduced following consultation with residents this summer.&nbsp;</p>

	<li>New report reveals national rough sleeping situation</li>
	<li>Brighton &amp; Hove figures included</li>
	<li>Help is available locally for those in need but services are stretched</li>
</ul>

<h2>Government figures</h2>

<p>The national announcement of rough sleeping figures from across the country shows there is still a staggering number of vulnerable people in need of help to move away from the streets.</p>

<p>In the report released today (Thursday 31 January) by the Ministry of Housing Community and Local Government (MHCLG), Brighton &amp; Hove remains in the 10&nbsp;areas experiencing the highest numbers of people rough sleeping.</p>

<p>New services and shelters have improved the situation locally in the last twelve months but the number of people continuing to flow onto the street remains high.</p>

<h2>Annual count</h2>

<p>The MHCLG statistics are based on the annual counts which take place nationally on one night in November. Our local count took place on Wednesday 21 November and <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2018/support-rough-sleepers-making-difference"">details were shared in December</a>.</p>

<p>The city was split into 13 patches. Teams of outreach workers and volunteers worked together to make a record of people bedded down in the city after midnight and through the early hours on the count night.</p>

<p>64 people were found sleeping rough. The count was verified by independent observers from the organisation Homeless Link.</p>

<p>The figure for 2018 cannot be directly compared with the previous year because the method was changed following discussions with the ministry about how other areas conduct their counts. However, when combined with other local data sources, the downward trend becomes clearer.</p>

<h2>Housing crisis</h2>

<p>Cllr Claire Moonan,&nbsp;lead councillor for rough sleeping, said: “We’re experiencing an ongoing national housing crisis and it’s shocking how quickly someone can end up in dire need on the streets.</p>

<p>“Helping people move away from rough sleeping is a priority for this council and, working with our partners, we’re making a positive sustainable&nbsp;difference to people’s lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’ve invested in services and successfully bid to government for funding to run new shelters and expand support for people who are rough sleeping. We’re moving in the right direction but I’m concerned about what the future holds when the current government funding ends in March 2020, little over a year away. The flow of new rough sleepers every week still remains very high.</p>

<p>“While the number of people who are sleeping rough at any time is considerably lower than in previous years, there is still much work to be done. In particular, to address the underlying causes of rough sleeping and homelessness at a national level. As far as I am concerned, even one person rough sleeping is too many. We will do all we can to help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“At the same time, our services are stretched and we urge anyone without accommodation arranged not to come to the city.”</p>

<h2>Regular research</h2>

<p>The council and partners monitor the situation locally to tailor services according to need. Regular street counts are carried out across a wide area of the city covering the vast majority of people rough sleeping. A comprehensive overview is also provided by a database, shared by agencies supporting those in need, which is updated daily with information from across the city.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Make Change Count</h2>

<p>Local charities have been given a boost from citywide fundraising which has raised more than £40,000. The Make Change Count alternative giving campaign has been running for several years, raising awareness of how to help people who are rough sleeping without giving money directly on the street.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Cllr Clare Moonan, lead councillor for rough sleeping said: “Residents and visitors have demonstrated great compassion through the generous donations which mean each charity will receive more than £5,000. The vital and valuable services provided for rough sleepers by partners across the city are making a real difference for many vulnerable people. We continue to support and work with&nbsp;our partners, recognising their expertise in helping those with complex needs to regain hope for the future and a life away from the streets.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jo Berry, Head of Fundraising, Marketing and PR, <strong>BHT</strong>, said: “We would like to say a big thank you to everyone who has donated so generously to the Make Change Count Campaign. The funding received through this campaign will be put towards the running costs of BHT’s First Base day centre which provides a wide range of services to people who are sleeping rough in the city, including food, shower, laundry and clothing facilities.”</p>

<p>Alison Marino, Executive Director, <strong>Sussex Nightstop</strong>, said: “Sussex Nightstop is very much about a community response to homelessness and we will use this funding to ensure that our host volunteers can continue to provide safe accommodation, a warm meal and access to washing facilities to young people at risk of the dangers of sleeping rough. On behalf of everyone at Sussex Nightstop we would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who donated to the Make Change Count campaign.”</p>

<p>Will Williams, Area Manager Brighton, <strong>Equinox</strong>, said: “The generosity of the general public across Brighton &amp; Hove has been fantastic and is very gratefully received by the clients Equinox supports. &nbsp;This resource goes a long way in providing emergency items for clients who are street homeless, helps assist us provide more personalised drug and alcohol support and long term recovery solutions for people who have become institutionalised on the street.”</p>

<p>Steve Brunton,<strong> Antifreeze</strong> (part of Off the Fence) Manager, said: “We’d like to thank you greatly for choosing to provide donations so that we can help the homeless. In 2018, 668 different homeless individuals accessed our services here at our Antifreeze Day Centre where they received basic needs such as haircuts, clothes and toiletries and more complex support through our one to one professional care. In addition to this, our charity provides many other services including evening outreach, plus laundrette and shower vans providing a service to the homeless.”</p>

<p>Kathleen Sims, Head of Outreach,<strong> St Mungo’s</strong>, said: “This funding is a boost and we’re always moved by the many ways people in Brighton &amp; Hove want to help. We’re helping people who are rough sleeping regain their dignity by helping with replacing ID and providing support to access basic rights which so many of us take for granted. Thank you to everyone who donated and is helping us make change count.”</p>

<p class=""default"">Brighton &amp; Hove is well-known for the variety and quality of its festivals and events - the city holds around 250 every year. Many of these are free and use public spaces such as the seafront and parks, as well as cultural places such as the Royal Pavilion Garden.</p>

<p class=""default"">The council plays a major part in helping events to happen and has developed a draft Outdoor Events Strategy to 2024. It aims to provide a greater focus on the quality, distinctiveness and impact of events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""default"">We offer a dedicated events service which brings together a wealth of experience from across the council, including cleansing and waste, roads management, technical infrastructure and venues.</p>

<h2 class=""default"">What does the draft strategy propose?</h2>

<p class=""default"">An Outdoor Events Charter – the first in the country – to build better relationships between event organisers, residents and businesses.</p>

<p class=""default"">In signing the charter, the council would simplify the application process and assist the planning of priority events which in turn helps provide financial support for community events.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Organisers would sign up to ensuring that their event makes a positive contribution to the quality of life for local communities and the local economy, including looking after the environment and minimising disruption.</p>

<p class=""default"">The charter includes a commitment to sustainability, such as not using single use plastic and re-using and recycling wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""default"">Other proposals for discussion include:</p>

<ul>
	<li class=""default"">The potential for a winter festival in Brighton &amp; Hove</li>
	<li class=""default"">Finding ways to connect event organisers so they can support one another (particularly useful for smaller events) and build on local expertise&nbsp;</li>
	<li class=""default"">Continue to invest in community activities through income generated by commercial events. Community events are not charged a fee if there are no road closures involved.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""default"">Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the &nbsp;city’s culture, tourism and culture committee, said: “We have a national reputation for staging fantastic events in the city, from Brighton Festival and Fringe, Pride and the Brighton Marathon, to Burning the Clocks, Paddle Round the Pier and the Take Part Festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of the Tourism, Development and Culture Committee are also being asked to approve spending £25,000 to re-submit a Round 1 Heritage Lottery bid in March.</p>

<p>The Grade 11 listed Royal Pavilion Garden was added to the Historic England at Risk Register last year following concerns about high levels of visitor use, erosion of character and a general deterioration in the sense of history. Historic England called for a Conservation Plan to be developed to address issues as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>A plan was drawn up, a consultation launched, attracting more than 1,300 responses, and a bid &nbsp;submitted for £194,000 to develop the plans ready for a funding bid for £3.3 million.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bid was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>However, the Heritage Lottery Fund encouraged the council to re-submit, highlighting work that should be undertaken in the meantime. &nbsp;This includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carrying out an access audit</li>
	<li>Developing designs of what a new boundary and improved entrances might look like</li>
	<li>Providing evidence of how multi agency working will tackle anti-social behaviour</li>
	<li>Providing more details of an activity programme, interpretation strategy and volunteer roles and skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>The estimated cost of this work is £25,000 which would be met from the Royal Pavilion and Museums core budgets.</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">Public art inspired by shipbuilding will create a local wildlife haven in Portslade.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This month local designers Millimetre will begin installing the structure on Wharf Road embankment, a triangular shaped piece of land next to the road at the entrance to Shoreham Port and Hove Lagoon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Inspiration for the project came from a technique known as ‘spline’ which comes from the shipbuilding industry. It is where long thin strips of wood or metal are bent and held in place under stress creating smooth, curving shapes. In shipbuilding it minimises the vessel’s drag in the water.</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">Designer and Project Manager Adam Harris said: “The brief to environmentally and artistically enhance the space gave us the opportunity to combine a sculptural structure with an ecological underpinning. The piece will evolve as the plants establish and gradually envelope the structure creating a green wall that will help absorb carbon emitted by the stream of passing traffic.”</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"">&nbsp;<br />
They will be planting climbers to cover the structure and surrounding it with wildflowers and herbs, native plants and grasses. It will add to the chalk butterfly bank (established in 2014), increase wildlife habitat in the area and help to increase green corridors in the Shoreham Harbour area.</p>

"33556","<p>Visitors to Brighton Museum can step back in time to the Ice Age and come face to face with Saxons when a fascinating new archaeology gallery opens its doors.</p>

<p>The new <a href=""https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/brighton/exhibitions-displays/the-elaine-evans-archaeology-gallery/"">Elaine Evans Archaeology Gallery</a> which opens on Saturday 26 January, follows the stories of seven people, five who were early residents of Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XlTQPtANfk"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>Using scientific research from their remains, 3D reconstructions have been recreated to show what they may have looked like.</p>

<p>As the newest archaeology gallery in the UK, the Brighton Museum space has been designed to get away from the traditional glass cases full of pots and flints.</p>

<p>Instead the gallery has been designed to appeal to children who study the time period as part of the National Curriculum. Teachers and education specialists have been involved in the creation of the new gallery along with members of the Sussex Archaeology Society.</p>

<h2>Step back in time</h2>

<p>The gallery uses sound, film and images to illustrate life in Saxon times including the sound of people working, cooking and sawing.</p>

<p>Museum curator Richard Le Saux said: “I’m very proud of the new gallery and we hope visitors will find it fascinating.</p>

<p>“We think it will be very exciting to come face to face with our local ancestors with our 3D reconstructions and see how they helped to shape our lives.”</p>

<h2>Amber Cup</h2>

<p>The museum will also feature some of the most important historical finds from the Sussex area including the internationally important Amber Cup, one of the largest prehistoric amber objects found in the world, the beautiful Romano-British bronze Woodingdean Stag, designated as an item of national significance by the government and the Sarsen Stone, found in Mile Oak believed to be part of a neolithic henge which would have been placed to track the movements of the sun and the moon.</p>

<h2>Story telling</h2>

<p>Children will also be able to enjoy an original adventure story and illustrations produced by local author Imogen White and illustrator Jennifer Khatun. The story follows Elva a young girl which will give young people the chance to imagine life as a Brighton &amp; Hove child in the past.</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the tourism, development and culture committee said: “We are extremely proud to be opening our new, exciting and innovative archaeology gallery.</p>

<p>“By bringing the past to life, with special effects, sights and sounds we hope we can inspire and educate a whole new generation of young people.”</p>

<h3>Chinoiserie-on-Sea</h3>

<p>“I grew up in a seaside town, but Brighton to me seemed exciting, exotic, and it symbolised art and freedom,” said Stephen. “In 2012, I designed a collection called ‘Chinoiserie-on-Sea’ for which I researched Brighton, and in particular the Pavilion, extensively; and it feels like showing my hats there is almost like a homecoming. I have never had the opportunity to display hats in the environment which inspired them.”</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Food and feasting inspired hats are placed among&nbsp;the copper pots in the Great Kitchen, from a giant swan headdress to a knitted ‘English breakfast’ hat</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hats from Chinoiserie-on-Sea - Jones’ homage to the grandeur of the Royal Pavilion – including hats inspired by its famous domes and the exquisite Chinese inspired interiors are on display in the entrance hall</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hats inspired by the interiors of the Royal Pavilion made for the China: Through the Looking Glass exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art will be on show in the Music Room along with gowns by the House of Dior</p>

<p>The group has been working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, which owns the site, to submit the bid for the project which aims to raise awareness of the importance of the Manor, and celebrate Portslade’s heritage since 1066.</p>

<p>Hidden away behind St Nicolas Church, Portslade Old Manor House is one of a very few examples of Norman Manor Houses that still exist in England. The ruins include parts of the original east and south walls as well as part of an early 17th century west wing extension.</p>

<p>Medieval manor houses are extremely rare in this country and Portslade Manor House has been declared a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II listed building.</p>

<h2>Volunteer training</h2>

<p>The Lottery Funding will be used to provide support and training for a team of 15 local people to research the history of the Manor, and its importance to Portslade over the last 900 years.</p>

<p>The research will be displayed on information boards around the Old Manor site, giving a timeline from the 11th century to the present day.</p>

<p>Volunteers will be trained in heritage conservation and grounds maintenance to become guardians of the site, ensuring its upkeep and protection for future generations.</p>

<h2>Bringing history to life</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, a trustee of Fresh Start and chair of the council’s tourism, development and culture committee said:</p>

<p>“We are absolutely delighted that the Heritage Lottery Fund has recognised the importance of preserving Portslade Old Manor House.</p>

<p>“The Manor Ruins are currently hidden behind fencing, with few people having any knowledge of their history. Our project will open up the site, preserve what is left of this important building and bring its fascinating history to life for future generations.”</p>

"34726","<p>Excitement is already building in Brighton &amp; Hove ahead of the UEFA European Women’s Championship&nbsp;in 2021.</p>

<p>The American Express Community Stadium is one of nine match venues for the prestigious competition. Last Friday’s qualifying draw saw 47 competing countries set into nine groups. As the host nation, England is already through to the knockout stages.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, along with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and Sussex County Football Association are working together to prepare for the tournament and host top-level European football in the city</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Women’s team manager and former England manager Hope Powell explains how women’s football is developing both nationally and locally, how the Albion is investing in the women’s game and why the stadium and wider city is the perfect location for such a high profile event.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove has a successful track record in hosting major sporting events, including the Rugby World Cup in 2015.</p>

<p>In 2014, the city welcomed Stage 7 of the Tour of Britain bike race and the annual Brighton Marathon is the UK’s second largest.</p>

<p>EURO 2021 will showcase the city to an international audience, supporting tourism and the local economy. In 2017, when England reached the semi-finals, the UEFA women’s Euro viewing figures reached a global audience of 165 million.</p>

<h2>Prestigious tournament</h2>

<p>Albion chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber, said: “Our stadium has a proven track record and a growing reputation for hosting some of the world’s biggest sporting events, and it is great that we will have the chance to do so once again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We will continue to work very closely with Sussex County FA and Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, in supporting The FA with hosting such a prestigious tournament.”</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the council’s tourism, development and culture committee, added: “We’re over the moon to be one of the host cities for EURO 2021.It’s a fantastic boost for women’s football in the region and a great accolade for the city.</p>

<p>“As a host city we have a real opportunity to help raise the profile of women’s football locally and nationally.”</p>

<h2>Showcasing skills</h2>

<p>Sussex County FA chief executive, Ken Benham, commented: “We’re delighted that some of the finest female players from across Europe will be showcasing their skills right here in Sussex.</p>

<p>“The tournament has the power to inspire and we hope it will encourage more people into the game.</p>

<p>“We have opportunities for all ages and abilities to get involved with football, so we’re really looking forward to the increased exposure the championships will bring to the local area.”</p>

"33396","<p>Six law breakers who were caught dropping litter on the street have been fined a total of £5004 – or £834 each.</p>

<p>The huge fines were issued at Brighton Magistrates Court after the offenders failed to pay the initial £75 fixed penalty notice and then didn’t attend court, despite being summoned.</p>

<p>The offences took place on Junction Road and Boundary Road, Portslade, and Western Road, Brighton.</p>

<p>It is against the law for people to:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;drop or throw away litter, including cigarette butts<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fly-tip or fly-post<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not pick up their dog's mess if they foul in public space</p>

<p>Anyone caught is given an on-the-spot fine between £75 and £300, depending on the type of offence.</p>

<p>If the fine isn’t paid within 28 days, the case goes to court where the offender will face a higher fine plus costs.</p>

<p>In this case, each of the six defendants didn’t pay within the time or bother to turn up to court. They were fined £440, told to pay £350 costs plus a £44 victim surcharge, totalling £834 each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “We’re determined to stamp out littering and these convictions show we take this type of crime very seriously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added: “We will not sit back and watch our beautiful city become dirty because someone can’t be bothered to find a bin for their cigarette butt or rubbish, or clean up after their dog.</p>

<p>“Nor will we stand aside and let people fly-tipping their unwanted items beside a communal bin, expecting the council to take them away at the expense of other council tax payers.</p>

<p>“We will continue to gather evidence and fine offenders. If they fail or refuse to pay, we will take them to court where they will be handed much bigger fines and a criminal prosecution, as these offenders have found out.”</p>

<h2>Offenders who don’t pay the fine</h2>

<p>By law, anyone caught littering must give their full name and address to the council’s enforcement officers who then verify the person using electronic ID verification systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Failure to give the correct name and address can lead to a £1,000 fine and a criminal conviction.</p>

<p>If the offender then fails to pay the fixed penalty notice, the case progresses to the local Magistrates Court with the maximum penalty of £2,500.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As littering is a criminal offence and not a civil offence, anyone found guilty will not only face a bigger fine than the original £75, they will also have a criminal conviction against their name.<br />

"34791","<p>Great news! Today we’ve launched a fantastic new <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-a-z"">A to Z guide on how you can reduce, reuse, recycle or dispose</a> of almost 180 different materials.</p>

<p>The easy-to-use guide gives detailed explanations of what to do with everything from aerosols to mattresses and nappies to Tetra Paks, to ensure we’re all being as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>

<p>The A to Z also gives advice on what to do with materials like rubble, plasterboards, asbestos, bathroom fittings, furniture, white goods, batteries and metal.</p>

<p>The guide launches our new drive to help residents recycle the correct things far more. In turn, this will help reduce the large number of recycling bins that we collect which are contaminated with non-recyclable products.</p>

<h2><strong>Why a guide is very helpful</strong></h2>

<p>We all want a cleaner city and a better world, and recycle as much as we can and with the best intentions. We all know we can recycle items like plastic bottles, paper, cardboard and glass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you’re unsure about what to do with specific items or materials, and put the wrong ones in your recycling, this can lead to your bin being contaminated and possibly being taken to waste rather than be recycled.</p>

<p>Using the guide, which can be easily accessed online by phone, computer or tablet, means contamination of your recycling can be avoided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also means items and materials can be reduced, or reused by yourself or someone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “I’m sure many of us have been in the situation where we don’t know what to do with a certain material or item. Do we put it in our recycling? Bin it? Give it away?</p>

<p>“Now, armed with our new A to Z, we’ll all be able to do the right thing and help protect our city and our planet better, and ensure we’re making the best use of the materials we no longer want or need.”</p>

<h2><strong>How to use the guide</strong></h2>

<p>You should log onto <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-0"">www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/recycling</a>. Click on the ‘<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-a-z"">Recycling A to Z</a>’ link and you can then search 179 items alphabetically.</p>

<p>The guide uses what’s called the ‘waste hierarchy’, starting with how to firstly <strong>reduce</strong> the use of a material or item, then how to <strong>reuse</strong> it, then <strong>recycle</strong> and finally, when none of the others can be done, the best way to <strong>dispose</strong> of it.</p>

<p>In the case of plastic bags, first of all the A to Z suggests using a reusable bag rather than a plastic one. If that can’t be done, the next suggestion is how to reuse the plastic bag, for instance as a bin liner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that’s not possible, we say whether it can be recycled – plastic bags cannot – and then how it should be disposed of.</p>

<h2><strong>Other items and materials</strong></h2>

<p>As materials vary enormously, the use of <strong>reduce, reuse, recycle, dispose</strong> varies also.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, we only say that styrofoam, which is used in packaging, cannot be recycled but should be disposed of in your household rubbish. However, textiles can be reused or recycled.</p>

<p>Cllr Mitchell added: “Although our recycling rate is the highest it’s ever been, we must aim much higher. We’re hoping this guide is a game changer in helping us all to recycle more and reduce contamination.”</p>

"33586","<p>We are very pleased to have been successful in our bid for £6 million of funding for Valley Gardens Phase 3 which was announced this week. As part of our consultation and stakeholder engagement we are taking on board feedback provided to us and using it to develop the proposed design of the scheme.</p>

<p>Here Councillor Gill Mitchell sets out our vision for Valley Gardens.</p>

<drupal-entity alt=""Councillor Gill Mitchell"" data-align=""right"" data-embed-button=""file_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""image:image"" data-entity-embed-display-settings=""{&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;image_link&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""96c9ce92-8ec8-411d-bf22-0c1f602d253c""></drupal-entity>

<h2>A new central park</h2>

<p>Valley Gardens is the name given to the green spaces that run from St Peter’s Church to the seafront. It is one of Brighton &amp; Hove’s overlooked gems, home to a National Elm Collection of international significance and a conservation area which forms an important part of the city’s heritage.</p>

<p>However, over time, this oasis of green has become a series of inaccessible traffic islands with busy roads on both sides cutting the area off from the communities around it. Rather than adding to the city’s renowned cultural and tourism offer, the current environment provides a poor first impression of people’s enjoyment of this part of the city centre, including those visitors arriving in the city at Brighton Station just a short walk away.</p>

<p>Our vision for Valley Gardens is to enhance the area’s green spaces and create new public spaces for people to spend time in, which will be linked together to create a single continuous public park. Simplifying the surrounding road layout and creating dedicated and connected walking and cycling routes will make travelling around the area safe and accessible for residents, commuters and visitors, in the most sustainable way.</p>

<h2>Making the area safer</h2>

<p>Work is currently underway on the first two phases of the project, from St Peter’s Church to Edward Street, and is on track to be completed in two years.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the Valley Gardens scheme, which focuses on the Old Steine to Palace Pier area is a continuation of Phases 1 &amp; 2 and vital to achieving a coordinated and well planned set of fresh, new gardens, paths and road links down to the sea.</p>

<p>Making the area safer for all transport users is a key objective; the existing area has the highest number of collisions in the city and conditions for cycling are particularly dangerous on the seafront.</p>

<p>The scheme will help address this by introducing a traffic signal T junction at the Palace Pier and create a significant missing link in the city centre’s cycling network and much improved and more direct crossings for walking. New ‘intelligent’ traffic signals will coordinate and balance traffic flows with pedestrian and cycling movements in a far better way than at present.</p>

<h2>Improved access to sustainable travel&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We are already one of the country’s least car-dependent cities outside London. More than a third of the city’s residents do not own a car and nearly twice as many people walk to work compared with the rest of the UK. We also have one of the most efficient and well used bus networks outside of the capital, connecting local people from around the city and enabling quick, short travel.</p>

<p>We are therefore developing the city’s public transport network with a future in mind in which reliance on cars for short journeys is reduced, air quality is improved and access to sustainable travel is made easier for everyone. Nowhere is this more important than in the centre of our beautiful city.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Consultation and engagement</h2>

<p>To get this far, Phase 3 of the project has been through the council’s robust democratic process, which requires a majority vote to be passed at a committee to enable major capital projects like this one to advance to the next stage of development. Approval by the Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) Committee has been sought at each stage of this project, effectively giving council officers additional delegated authority to conduct further work.</p>

<p>Last summer we consulted people on their impressions of the area, how they used it and what they would like to see improved. Over 800 people gave us their views and we used their comments to develop the eight core principles on which to base the new designs. Forty four design options were whittled down to four and then down to the preferred option – Option 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Option 1 was determined as the one which best meets the aims and objectives of the scheme overall and was therefore approved for public consultation. A six week public consultation which began in October 2018 and was widely publicised, gathered feedback from residents and stakeholders on this option and this has directly influenced the further development of the scheme which will be reported to ETS committee when it meets on 7 February.</p>

<h2>Securing funding&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The estimated cost of the project is £7.84 million, the majority of which (£6 million) will come from a central government pot of money called the Local Growth Fund (LGF) and is money that is set aside for projects that benefit the local area and economy, including transport. This money cannot be spent on any other council services or projects.</p>

<p>The Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), which approved the £6 million allocation, requires the local authority to contribute funding for the project of at least 15% of the project cost. This means that the remainder of the funding for the project, currently estimated at £1.84 million, will come from the council’s Local Transport Plan budget, local contributions and potentially private sector development contributions. The LEP also requires that we spend the project funding by a certain deadline, which in this case is March 2021.</p>

<p>Securing funding from the LEP and seeking approval from ETS committee on 7 February marks an important point in the project’s programme, which will again be followed by another round of public consultation.</p>

<h2>Emphasising the area's historic character</h2>

<p>On completion, the whole of the Valley Gardens will become a more attractive, accessible and usable city centre space which will emphasise the area’s historic and cultural character, and enhance key tourist attractions including the Royal Pavilion and Palace Pier.</p>

<p>Reconnecting the green spaces to the surrounding network of unique shopping streets, hotels and places to eat and relax will ensure that it’s potential as a public open space is fully realised and make Valley Gardens a destination in its own right.</p>

"33731","<p>Brighton &amp; Hove continues to have the highest rate of bus use outside London with 49.2 million passenger journeys made in 2017/18, up from 45.6 million in 2015/16 and a significant rise from the 40.8 million passenger journeys made in 2009/10. Twice as many passenger journeys are being made now than in&nbsp;1993.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working in partnership</h2>

<p>The continued popularity of the bus in the city can be explained by the council’s award-winning Quality Bus Partnership with the bus operators, which creates the conditions for frequent, effective services run with modern vehicles and the latest information technology.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council works with Brighton &amp; Hove Buses, The Big Lemon and Compass Travel to support zero and low emission bus services across the city. We plan and fund&nbsp;a number of bus services including some complete routes and a number of weekend and school services. &nbsp;As these services are not profitable, they would not run without council funding. The council’s overall budget for supporting bus services is £1,041,900 per year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sustainable travel</h2>

<p>All of the city’s buses are fitted with the latest Euro 6 low emission engines which meet clean air requirements. The Big Lemon buses are now solar powered, having previously run on waste cooking oil. It is expected that their electric bus fleet will be up and running in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supporting sustainable bus travel is parts of the council’s wider strategy to improve air quality in the city, which has included securing government funding to fit 76 buses and 22 taxis with clean air technology, introducing a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and establishing an Air Quality Programme Board. This year, 200 electric vehicle charging points will be installed across the city thanks to a successful bid by the council for £300,000 of government funding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell, said: “We are committed to supporting low emission, sustainable travel to help improve air quality in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have the highest rate of bus use of any local authority outside of London so it is vital that we do everything we can to improve the efficiency and reduce the emissions of the city’s buses.</p>

<p>“A lot of work has been done with the local bus companies to ensure we are joined up in our approach and we look forward to continuing our work with them to see what more can be done.”&nbsp;</p>

"33766","<p>Revisions&nbsp;have been made to the design option for&nbsp;the scheme to&nbsp;take into account the feedback submitted&nbsp;by residents and stakeholders during the latest public consultation.</p>

<p>An initial scoping consultation in Summer 2018 gathered the views of local residents, businesses and users as to how the area is used, what issues there are in travelling around the &nbsp;current area and priorities for improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second stage of public consultation&nbsp;ran for six weeks&nbsp;from 15 October to 25 November 2018 providing residents and stakeholders the opportunity to have their say on the proposed design option for the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were 828 responses to the consultation which overall were favourable and indicated clear support for the majority of the proposals included in the design. Feedback provided was taken into account and considered in relation to the projects core design objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revised proposals include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The creation of a dedicated southbound priority lane for buses, taxis and coaches</li>
	<li>Improved junction alignments to provide direct, convenient connections and more space for pedestrians and cyclists on the seafront promenade</li>
	<li>Improved north-south connections for cyclists and the realignment &nbsp;of the new north-south cycle lane</li>
	<li>Footpaths to create more direct links with North Street, The Lanes, St James’s Street and the Seafront across the Steine Gardens&nbsp;</li>
	<li>More parking bays for blue badge holders, doctors parking bays and loading bays &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Officers will now&nbsp;proceed to the detailed design stage, with further public consultation due to take place as plans develop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell, said: “There has been extensive public information and consultation to date on the Valley Gardens Phase 3 project. We have taken on board the feedback provided and this has been used to develop the option further. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is a significant opportunity to revitalise the Old Steine to Palace Pier area by improving the transport and public realm infrastructure. The aim is to make cycling, walking and public transport more attractive and viable options of transport, as well as improving the landscape to create an attractive, sustainable and safe green space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Making the area safer for all transport users is a key objective; the existing area has the highest number of collisions in the city and conditions for cycling are particularly dangerous on the seafront. The area is also one of the main arrival points into the city and the redesign will enhance the quality of the environment to reflect the city’s status as a key visitor destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are very pleased to have been successful in our bid for £6 million of funding for the scheme from the Local Enterprise Partnership. Officers will now be able to proceed to the detailed design stage and work towards delivering the scheme by 2021.”</p>

"33911","<p>The Office for Low Emission Vehicles (Olev) has granted&nbsp;the city £468,000 to introduce electric taxi hubs and rapid charging facilities.</p>

<p>Our&nbsp;bid was awarded in full and will pay for 75% of the scheme to provide a network of charging facilities for taxis across the city. The remaining 25% will be paid for through a concession agreement, with a portion of the charge coming back to the council.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What we will do</strong></h2>

<p>Taxis will benefit from four rapid charging electric vehicle hubs in the city. Each hub will have three rapid charging stations and will be for taxi use. The infrastructure is designed to support taxi operators in choosing electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Councillor Gill Mitchell, chair of the city’s environment, transport &amp; sustainability committee, said: “This money will support local companies who want to introduce electric vehicles to their fleet by ensuring they have the infrastructure to operate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s part of our aim, in partnership not only with taxi drivers, but also with public transport operators, businesses, residents and visitors to support and encourage the move &nbsp;towards zero emissions and improved air quality for all who live, work and visit the city.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Taxi survey</strong></h2>

<p>Our licensing team have played an important part in talking to the taxi trade and worked with transport officers on the bid.</p>

<p>In a council survey of taxi and private hire drivers and companies, 81% of those responding said that their cars currently use diesel but almost a third said they would consider changing to an electric vehicle in the next one to two years and 43% said they had seen an electric vehicle they would like to buy but would not do so until there were more places to charge. The cost of charging an electric vehicle would be much cheaper than conventional fuel.</p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent said that dedicated taxi charging points were ‘essential’ and almost half (47%) said they would be likely to charge their vehicle at a public car park with shops or a café which fits in with our strategy to install rapid charging hubs with nearby facilities. Almost 92% said they were likely to charge their vehicles at home off shift, meaning they would start the day with a full charge, so providing a rapid charge facility mid shift would be an ideal solution for them.</p>
