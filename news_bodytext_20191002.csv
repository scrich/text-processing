33736,"<p>Business leaders joined celebrations at the city’s CEDP (Chinese Educational Development Project) Centre last&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;to welcome in the Year of the Pig.</p>

<p>As well as a spectacular show that included traditional lion dancing and musical performances from local school and college children, the annual event,&nbsp;now in its 19th year, included a business element for the first time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The event was designed to explore&nbsp;the opportunities and challenges of doing business with China.</p>

<p>Max Woodford, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's&nbsp;assistant director of regeneration and investment, gave an overview of the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000855/M00006638/AI00066106/$20180404164520_016156_0056507_GreaterBrightonTradeandInwardInvestmentStrategyFinal.pdfA.ps.pdf"">Greater Brighton&nbsp;Inward Investment &amp; Trade Strategy</a> before inviting members of the audience to&nbsp;direct their questions to a panel of business experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strategy has been developed to help the City Region realise its potential as one of the UK’s leading locations for investment and trade.</p>

<p>Panellists included Brighton &amp;&nbsp;Hove City Council chief executive&nbsp;Geoff Raw;&nbsp;John McLean OBE, chairman of several China based companies as well as&nbsp;a Vice Chairman of the Institute of Directors (IoD); Dr&nbsp;Aijuan Wang, Strategic Development Director of China at Mott MacDonald; and Xabi Izaguirre, Head of Planning at Oban International..</p>

34826,"<p>We’re exploring the best location to start restoration of the first three arches to showcase the project. These will be funded by the successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>We are continuing to assess the condition of the western-most arches. The thinking behind the proposal to restore these first is:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>They would offer easy access for all</li>
	<li>Need less ‘propping’ and ‘dismantling’ (to prevent the rest of the Terrace from collapsing and separate the unstable parts from those being restored) as these arches are at one end</li>
	<li>Being close to the Palace Pier and bus/coach drop-off points with high visitor footfall would help make the most of the showcased arches</li>
	<li>Community input is a key part of the restoration&nbsp;and <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=117&amp;MId=8153&amp;Ver=4"">the council meeting on 28 March</a> will respond to a petition asking for the work to start work further to the east of the Terrace, by Concorde 2.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Our project team is looking at this option in more detail, including how it will impact on costs and the original objectives of the crowd funding.</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee, said: “We share the community’s aim of making sure we get the final decision on location right. We are committed to working with all the Terrace’s supporters to reach our shared goal of restoring the whole of Madeira Terrace.”</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>We are looking forward to submitting a renewed funding bid to the National Heritage Lottery Fund (NHLF) in May. We recently received more information about how the future bidding process will work and how we can fit in with NHLF priorities which are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Landscapes and nature</li>
	<li>Community heritage</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Brighton &amp; Hove has the potential to make an excellent case study both for community heritage and improving the biodiversity of the seafront.</p>

<h2>New site office</h2>

<p>The project has a new site office on Madeira Drive opposite the western end of Madeira Terrace.</p>

<p>It is providing a base for community activities, a site office and space for events’ organisers which will generate revenue for the project. Brighton half marathon organisers Sussex Beacon were the first customers.</p>

<h2>Learning more about the structure&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Final year Building Surveying students from the University of Brighton are using Madeira Terrace as a case study for their work, which includes creating a basic design for a ‘pod’ that could be used for a variety of commercial and leisure activities.</p>

<p>A full annual ‘special inspection’ of the whole Terrace, commissioned by our property and design team, took place at the end of February.</p>

35191,"<p>Construction workers in the city are set to benefit from a new agreement protecting workers’ rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council has signed up to the Unite the Union Construction Charter. The Charter ensures that working conditions for employees on construction projects under council control meet the highest standards.</p>

<p>The Charter will soon come into force in Brighton &amp; Hove following agreement on how best to implement its provisions at the council’s recent Procurement Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Charter supports increased fairness for workers by laying out eleven requirements for contractors and their supply chain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Nancy Platts, lead for economic development and social value, said: “This is a positive step for the council and the city. The Charter will reinforce how the illegal practice of blacklisting workers won’t be tolerated and ensure fair pay through direct employment rather than umbrella company arrangements which can be costly for the construction worker.”</p>

<p>“We will work with construction companies to create genuine social value by enforcing the highest standards for their workers. What’s more, its spirit will promote the same standards for how these companies operate even when the council is not the direct client.”</p>

<p>The council will continue to link with Unite to deliver the Charter requirements, which cover direct employment status, health and safety, skills development, fair recruitment and measures to support the UK construction industry.</p>

<p>Sarah Carpenter, Unite regional secretary, said: “Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s decision to sign Unite’s pioneering Charter is a significant boost for construction workers. It shows that the council is really serious about the best standards for local construction projects.”</p>

<p>“The Construction Charter makes a difference by helping local workers to operate in a safe environment and helps them to raise health and safety issues without fear. The Charter also protects workers from bogus self-employment by ensuring construction workers are directly employed.”</p>

37306,"<p>An advisory panel bringing together a mix of community representatives, nominated by their own respective communities, is being created to work alongside the council in bringing forward the Madeira Terrace restoration. This follows a meeting with residents, community volunteers and businesses.</p>

<p>The panel will have up to 12 members made up of categories including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>community groups</li>
	<li>event organisers</li>
	<li>businesses</li>
	<li>tourism and conservation representatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel is likely to meet quarterly once different category groups are decided. In the next few weeks we’ll be inviting the community to put forward their nominated panel members and then work with them to arrange a date for the first Advisory Panel meeting.</p>

<p>More than 40 people attended last week’s meeting and speakers included the Regency Society, the Save Madeira Terrace Raffle Group and Building Green, a team of volunteers restoring the green wall.</p>

<h2>Community input is crucial</h2>

<p>Nick Hibberd, the council’s Executive Director for Economy, Environment &amp; Culture said: “I’d like to thank everyone who came for their commitment and enthusiasm for this unique heritage asset. Community input is crucial to making the restoration a success and the advisory panel will open up a practical way for those interested to stay involved and help place their vision at the heart of the restoration.</p>

<p>“We don’t underestimate the challenge of restoring 865m of a Victorian structure exposed to coastal weather and the resources we will need, but we can achieve our shared goals by working together and making things happen.”</p>

<p>Regenerating Madeira Terrace will provide a new future for the eastern seafront along Madeira Drive. A progress report will be taken to the next Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee on 20 June when councillors will discuss the next steps, including the need for a specialist design team to give the council and community partners a better understanding of the actual costs of achieving the restoration.</p>

<h2>£2 million earmarked from council capital reserves</h2>

<p>As well as the £460,000 raised through a crowdfunding campaign, the council has earmarked £2 million from capital reserves for Madeira Terrace. The funds were first made available to match two bids made to National Lottery Heritage Fund (NLHF) in 2018, but as the bids were unsuccessful, the council is reconsidering how to start work on the restoration.</p>

<h2>A landmark destination</h2>

<p>A total of 1,291 square feet (120 square metres) is available in the Rotunda Cafe, which sits at street level, providing an opportunity for smaller food and beverage operators.</p>

<p>Located in a prominent position on Brighton seafront, between the Palace Pier and i360, Shelter Hall will be a landmark destination for the 11 million tourists that visit the city. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Shelter Hall is larger than the previous building, with two internal floors, a rotunda on top and a roof terrace. The building will also incorporate new public toilets.</p>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the environment, transport &amp; sustainability committee, said: “The new Shelter Hall will provide a stunning new destination for the city’s residents and visitors and is a key part of the city’s seafront regeneration.

40081,"<p>R Durtnell &amp; Sons Ltd, the contractor working on the major refurbishment of Brighton Dome, Corn Exchange and Studio Theatre, has stopped work on site and is putting together proposals for a company voluntary arrangement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have taken back the site and made it secure. We are committed to completing the refurbishment of these unique buildings to protect their long-term future in the cultural heart of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the coming days we’ll be exploring practical options for continuing and completing these essential restoration works as soon as possible and taking forward the wider Royal Pavilion Estate project.</p>

<p>Royal Pavilion Estate includes the Royal Pavilion, Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Royal Pavilion Garden, Brighton Dome Concert Hall, Corn Exchange and Studio Theatre.</p>

<h1>About the project</h1>

<p>Brighton Dome Corn Exchange and Studio Theatre refurbishment is the first phase of a wider project to re-affirm Brighton’s Royal Pavilion Estate as a key cultural destination by equipping it for a sustainable future.</p>

<p>Our longer-term vision aims to reunite the historic Estate created by George IV in the early 19th century to create a centre for heritage, culture and the performing arts which reflects the unique spirit of Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>The project will develop, deepen and broaden the cultural tourism offer of Brighton &amp; Hove and significantly contribute to the city’s cultural and economic wellbeing. It is anticipated that the revitalised Royal Pavilion Estate will support 1,241 FTE jobs and have an economic impact of up to £68 million.</p>

<p>Our refurbishment will transform the Grade 1 listed Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, formerly the Prince Regent’s Riding House, which has the widest span timber frame roof in the country, and the Grade 2 listed Studio Theatre. The project will restore previously hidden heritage features as well as provide increased capacity seating, a magnificent new viewing gallery and a creative space for artists to rehearse and develop work.</p>

<p>Major improvements to the Studio Theatre - once a supper room - will include balcony seating, new bar facilities and a street level café opening out onto New Road.</p>

<p>Since construction work began in February 2017, the project has experienced several unforeseen issues on the historic site. A Quaker burial ground was uncovered in August 2017, with human remains excavated by a team of archaeologists and structural issues have been discovered with the Corn Exchange’s 200-year old wooden frame and roof trusses.&nbsp;</p>

40226,"<h2>Award</h2>

<p>The team behind Brighton &amp; Hove’s Volk’s railway, the oldest working electric railway in the world, has won a Public and Community Award from the Sussex Heritage Trust.</p>

<p>It recognises how the creation of a new visitor centre and new station by the Aquarium has vastly improved the railway for residents and visitors, attracting more than 400 people an hour at peak times.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the Tourism, Development and Culture Committee, said: “I think the great Victorian inventor Magnus Volk would be proud of what we have achieved. The dedication of staff and volunteers has led to far more people being able to enjoy the whole experience and learn about its history.</p>

<p>“We’re so pleased that our unique heritage project has won this local award as Volk’s railway is truly one of the treasures of Sussex.”</p>

<p>Since it was built in 1883 Volk’s Railway has been battered by sea storms and abandoned during world wars but the new buildings were constructed to last in the marine environment, with zinc and a unique ribbed rubber cladding. The pebble base is formed in stainless steel cages with pebbles redistributed from the beach.</p>

<p>Hove-based architects, ABIR, designed a&nbsp;new station and visitor centre to look like two train carriages on tracks passing one another. Inside the centre, you can discover the story of the railway and its inventor Magnus Volk.</p>

<p>Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the project also restored the 19<span style=""font-size: 12.5px;"">th&nbsp;</span>century railway carriages, which first took holidaymakers along Brighton seafront in 1883. Now back in use, they have increased accessibility and passenger capacity so more people can enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Midway along the track is a new conservation workshop where council staff supported by volunteers maintain the train carriages and develop skills in carpentry and engineering.</p>
","Judges from the Sussex Heritage Trust said the design, which includes exterior rubber cladding on the new ticket hall and cafe, was an unusual and clever use of materials and the buildings had enhanced the eastern end of Brighton seafront.","Business and economy"
40546,"<p>We’re supporting a local campaign to end the practice of unpaid trial shifts in the city.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.nounpaid.com/"">‘Say No To Unpaid Trial Shifts’</a> is a grassroots collective started by students in Brighton &amp; Hove. The campaign group say using unpaid trial shifts during the job application process is unacceptable—a view that councillors endorsed unanimously in a notice of motion last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An unpaid trial shift is where an employer fails to pay for work which either makes money from a prospective employee or saves money for the employer. The government issued <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculating-the-minimum-wage/calculating-the-minimum-wage"">new guidance as to what constitutes an unpaid trial shift</a> in December 2018.</p>

<p>We have pledged to look at how we can help end the practice of unpaid trial shifts. From 1 August we will be gathering information from businesses and prospective job applicants to understand the scale and nature of the issue:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/business/unpaid-trial-shifts-survey-for-businesses/"">Business survey</a></li>
	<li><a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/business/unpaid-trial-shifts-applicants-survey"">Workers, students and young people survey</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Why the council is taking action</h2>

<p>Cllr Amanda Evans, Brighton &amp; Hove’s Lead Member for Community Wealth Building said: “No-one should be expected to work for free so we want to collaborate with businesses and partners to put an end to unpaid labour that is unacceptable, unethical and unfair.</p>

<p>“The initiative is consistent with our support of the <a href=""https://www.livingwagebrighton.co.uk/"">Brighton &amp; Hove Living Wage campaign</a> and an extension of our commitment to raise standards, celebrate good employers, retain good candidates and ensure all those working in our city can share in the wealth they are helping to create.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.nounpaid.com/aboutus"">No Unpaid campaign group</a> says unpaid trial shifts target young people, take advantage of vulnerable job-seekers and allow businesses (including many high street brands) to avoid paying wages, staff training and tax—and are therefore damaging the UK economy.</p>

<p>Of the people who responded to their recent snapshot survey, many reported unpaid trial shifts in the hospitality sector, but also highlighted major high street retailers, as well as other industries including cleaning and care work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tourism supports nearly 22,000 jobs in Brighton &amp; Hove, with more than 1,000 businesses involved bringing over £800 million into the local economy. It equates to 7.5% of the tourism economy of the south east region*. An end to unpaid trial shifts in this sector will enable more people to share in the city’s economic success. Community wealth building is an aim of <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2019/city-introduces-new-economic-strategy"">the city’s economic strategy</a> introduced earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Surveys</h2>

<p>Councillor Evans added: “Our surveys will build on the work of the No Unpaid campaign group by giving us local information that we can use to find practical ways of tackling the issue.”</p>

<p>Targeted communication with students and young people will start in September to encourage them to fill in the applicants survey.</p>

</ul>

<p>Closing date for our&nbsp;survey is 31 October 2019.</p>

<h2>No unpaid campaign</h2>

<p>Campaign co-founder Frank Chamberlain said: “The work of young people is demeaned by the concept that we should be asked to work for free. Too many young people, competing in a saturated job market, feel like they have no choice but to undertake unpaid trial shifts, with no guarantee of a job at the end of it. On some occasions, it has become apparent that employers had no intention of offering a job at all.</p>

<p>“Given so many people, young people and otherwise, rely on a secure income, this practice is both unethical and exploitative. We hear horror stories of nine hour shifts and ridiculous anecdotes of compensation being given in the form of bread, beer and even spices. Even short unpaid trial shifts are time-consuming, and force vulnerable jobseekers into working for free. This is not acceptable in today’s society.”</p>

<p>Frank added: “We want ethical employers to help us raise awareness of this unacceptable practice by pledging not to undertake unpaid trial shifts. To date, more than 100 businesses have done so.”</p>

<p>Mark Turner from the GMB trade union said: “This is a very important campaign and the GMB is pleased to be part of it. This arrangement of unpaid trial shifts needs to be totally eradicated because it particularly disadvantages young people within society. We welcome that the council has signed up to this along with the city’s three MPs and we as a union will continue to campaign at a local and national level.”</p>

<p>Unpaid trial shifts can be reported to HMRC who investigate claims on a case by case basis. No Unpaid has simplified this process by providing an easy-to-use complaint letter-generator on its website. ACAS also provide free, confidential help and advice for workers.</p>

33286,"<p>Recent media articles have misrepresented work to tackle #periodpoverty which gained cross party support at a council committee earlier this month.&nbsp;The report does not say that boys will have periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000968/M00009226/$$Supp30547dDocPackPublic.pdf"">report put to the committee</a>&nbsp;was raised as part of the council's commitment to&nbsp;Poverty Proofing the School day.&nbsp;The seven&nbsp;page report sets out the challenges and support available for girls and young people facing issues around period poverty. The benefits of all pupils learning about periods as a way to remove stigma and confusion is a key focus of the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;report is clear about how: ""Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods"" and ""Pupils with very early onset puberty and trans pupils and students are provided&nbsp;with additional support perhaps from a school nurse, if needed."" These supporting comments are set in a much wider context and cannot be taken as&nbsp;stand alone statements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National statistics, included in the report,&nbsp;show:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>One in ten girls in the UK have been unable to afford period products</li>
	<li>49% of girls have missed an entire day of school because of their period</li>
	<li>Research also shows significant taboo and stigma surrounding periods and menstruation</li>
</ul>

<p>The debate covered&nbsp;a range of ways to&nbsp;tackle period poverty both in terms of access to products and the stigma of talking about periods among young people.</p>

<p>Councillors agreed to support the campaign by providing funding for the local Red Box project which distributes free period products to schools.&nbsp;The continuing work of the council’s PHSE (personal, sexual and health education)&nbsp;service and the school nursing service were also&nbsp;recognised as having a significant role in reducing stigma and shame related to periods and provide education on puberty and changes within the body.&nbsp;</p>

33581,"<p>Overall GCSE results in schools across Brighton &amp; Hove continue to outstrip the national average, according to newly-released government figures.</p>

<p>The city is four percentage points ahead of the national average in both the government’s key measures for English and maths combined:</p>

<ul>
	<li>68% of Brighton &amp; Hove students achieved grades 9-4 compared to the national average of 64%</li>
	<li>47% of Brighton &amp; Hove achieved grades 9-5 against a national average of 43%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most GCSEs are now being graded from 9 to 1, with 9 being the top grade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government describes a Grade 4 as a ‘standard’ pass, while a Grade 5 is a ‘strong’ pass.</p>

<p>The city is also ahead of the game for the government’s new ‘Attainment 8’ performance measure. This shows average attainment at individual schools across eight subjects.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove’s Attainment 8 figure is 48.0 compared to the national average of 46.5.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s executive director for families, children and learning, Pinaki Ghoshal, said:</p>

<p>“This year-on-year improvement comes on the back of improved results city-wide at both A-level and primary level.</p>

<p>“Hats off first and foremost to our young people and their teachers, who have worked really hard to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I think our schools team and the city’s Education Partnership also deserve credit for their continued collaboration to raise standards.</p>

<p>“This has also included an improvement city-wide in Progress 8, another key government measure.&nbsp;</p>

34006,"<p>A government minister has written to Brighton &amp; Hove City Council to praise a ‘substantial’ leap forward in children’s basic reading skills across the city.</p>

<p>The Rt Hon Nick Gibb MP, Minister of State for School Standards, was commenting on an improvement of 4.6 percentage points in the city’s annual phonics screening results.</p>

<p>Phonics is a way of teaching young children to ‘decode’ letters and words, and is seen as a key strategy for helping children learn to read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The improvement has taken Brighton &amp; Hove above the national average.</p>

<p>The Minister said: “Achieving early fluency in decoding is a necessary first step in acquiring the key skill of reading.</p>

<p>“This is a sizeable improvement and is a credit to the hard work and professionalism of teachers and headteachers in your local authority area.”</p>

<p>The chair of the council’s children, families and schools committee, Councillor Les Hamilton, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is about getting the basics right, and I’d like to thank all our schools and the council’s education team for the excellent work they are doing in this area.</p>

<p>“It’s the latest in a series of improvements in academic standards city-wide that we’ve seen in recent years – and it’s one that bodes very well for the future.” ENDS<br />

39251,"<p>Councillors on a key committee in Brighton &amp; Hove want the government to think again about its plan to privatise Moulsecoomb Primary School in Brighton by forcing it to become an academy.</p>

<p>Councillors across all three political groups on the children, young people and skills committee voted unanimously to call on the government’s Regional Schools Commissioner to consider improved standards as grounds for revoking the order.</p>

<p>The Commissioner’s decision to privatise the school followed an Ofsted inspection that rated the schools as ‘inadequate’.</p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>

<p>However, the same report noted that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>outcomes for pupils are rising in both key stage 1 and early years</li>
	<li>the council’s education team had provided a comprehensive package of support for the school</li>
	<li>many parents had spoken positively about the school.</li>
</ul>

<p>Councillors agreed that becoming an academy was not necessary to improve standards at the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have called on Ofsted to re-inspect the school in the autumn and see for themselves that issues around performance at key stage 2 have been addressed.</p>

<p>They have also asked council education officers to conduct a ballot of parents and carers of children at the school on whether they are in favour of the forced conversion of the school to a private academy trust.</p>

<h2>Strength of feeling</h2>

<p>Committee chair Nick Childs said: “We’ve united across political divides to call on the Regional Schools Commissioner to reconsider his decision to privatise Moulsecoomb Primary School.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This shows the strength of feeling on this issue and I’m delighted we’re working together for the good of the school.</p>

<p>“This decision has been taken without any consultation with the school, its parents, the local community or the council. I believe this is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>“Nobody I know who has read the Ofsted report thinks the ‘inadequate’ judgement makes sense.</p>

<p>“Ofsted’s own report acknowledges that standards are rising at all levels below key stage 2.</p>

<h2>Working hard</h2>

<p>“Everyone connected with the school is very confident that the new data we will get this summer will show that performance at key stage 2 is also improving at an acceptable rate.</p>

<p>“The headteacher and his team are working hard and successfully to improve the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We believe stopping this process through an unnecessary privatisation plan would be extremely damaging for pupils, parents and staff at the school.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>The motion agreed by the committee is as follows:</p>

<p>“This Committee notes that an order for academisation of Moulsecoomb Primary School was imposed by the Regional School’s Commissioner on behalf of the Secretary of State.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“On the conversion date Brighton &amp; Hove City Council shall cease to maintain the school and will be forced to transfer land and buildings occupied by the school to an academy trust chosen by the Regional Schools Commissioner (RSC) on behalf of the Department of Education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This Committee notes the extensive support being provided to the School by the Council and does not believe that an Academy sponsor is necessary to improve the standards of the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This committee opposes the privatisation of schools, and the imposition of academy orders against the will of the local community.</p>

<p>“The Committee instructs the officers to conduct a ballot of parents and carers of children on roll at Moulsecoomb Primary School on the question of whether they are in favour of or oppose the forced conversion of the School to an academy trust selected by the Regional Schools Commissioner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The result of the ballot should be shared with the Regional Schools Commissioner and will be published on the council website and communicated to parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Committee invites the RSC to consider inviting Ofsted to reinspect the school with a view to considering improved standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Committee notes the efforts being made to improve the standards of the school and calls upon the Regional Schools Commissioner to consider improved standards as grounds for revoking the order.”</p>

40116,"<p>A call will be made to the Secretary of State for Education to withdraw the order to force Moulsecoomb Primary School to become an academy. The order followed a recent Ofsted report which branded the school “inadequate”.</p>

<p>The academy decision has already been <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2019/government-re-think-called-moulsecoomb-academy-plan"">challenged by councillors from all political groups at a recent Children, Young People &amp; Skills committee</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Regional schools commissioner&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Now the leader of the council, Cllr Nancy Platts, and the deputy leader, Cllr Nick Childs, have met with representatives of the Regional School Commissioner to press for a re-think. The Regional School Commissioner was invited to Hove Town Hall and a meeting with his representatives took place on Tuesday (2 July).</p>

<p>Councillors explained: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The extensive support being given to the school</li>
	<li>Rapid positive changes underway&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The damaging and disruptive impact of the academy order on the improvements&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Standards are rising and this alone is grounds to halt the order&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Democratic process</h3>

<p>Cllr Childs is also the chair for Children, Young People and Skills Committee. Cllr Childs said: “We asked for a commitment from the commissioner’s team that they would accept and act on the outcome of a parental ballot. We also proposed reasonable time should be allowed for our school improvement plan to demonstrate more progress. They would give no such assurances.</p>

<p>“Instead they made their disregard for the views of local people and elected politicians very clear. More frustrating was their ideological obsession with privatisation as the only way to improve a school. This is in the face of clear evidence to the contrary when presented with the exemplary record of school performance in Brighton &amp; Hove.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;“We now have no alternative, as a council, but to write directly to the Secretary of State. We will be asking the Right Honourable Damian Hinds MP to exercise his powers to revoke the forced academy order without delay.”</p>

The letter to the Secretary of State for Education has been sent by the chair of the council’s children, young people and skills committee, Councillor Nick Childs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Childs said: “Nurseries in Brighton &amp; Hove are suffering because of an unfair government funding system that’s simply not fit for purpose.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“The funding rate we get from central government is well below average and does not take account of the high costs of running a nursery in Brighton &amp;&nbsp;Hove.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“As everyone knows, the cost of living here is pretty much in line with London prices.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Even more unfair is the fact that nurseries in other similar cities like Southampton, Reading and Bristol get a lot more funding per child per hour than we do.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Bristol gets £5.69 per child. Reading gets £5.14. Southampton gets £5.11.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“In Brighton &amp; Hove we only get £4.45. This is the lowest rate of any unitary authority in the south east.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“This is very difficult for all nurseries in the city and many are struggling. Nurseries open for longer hours can charge parents fees at a higher rate.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“This is not an option for nurseries only open for school hours, and so their situation is even worse.<br />

41156,"<p>Home to school transport is provided for 480 children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities who attend&nbsp;schools and colleges. Of these children, 30 faced major disruption to their arrangements at the start of this term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problems followed vehicle operators withdrawing at a very late stage from agreed home to school transport routes. From 14 August to 3 September, 14 out of a total of 127 routes were returned and needed reallocating. This affected 62 children and led to unprecedented strain on the service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Apology</h2>

<p>Cllr John Allcock’s first action on taking the role of chair of Children, Young People and Skills Committee at today’s meeting was to offer a full apology, promise action to resolve ongoing issues and announce an independent review into what went wrong.</p>

<p>Cllr Allcock said: “I want to make a direct and unreserved apology on behalf on the administration for the distress, anxiety and stress that has been caused to children, young people and families as a direct consequence of the change to Home to School Transport arrangements. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The absolute top priority at the moment is to ensure the wellbeing of the children and young people concerned.”</p>

<h2>Steps taken</h2>

<p>He explained what has been done so far and what the next steps will be to resolve the issues. Parents have been offered reassurance and specific ongoing issues are being looked into. A meeting will be arranged with PaCC (Parent and Carers Council) to discuss concerns. Contractors that pulled out of routes without providing the contractually agreed 30-day notice period will be contacted about their breach of agreement.</p>

<h2>Independent review</h2>

<p>The committee also heard that an Independent Review of the entire process has been instigated and an approach made to another Local Authority in the region to enable a thorough investigation. The results of the review will be reported to the Children, Young People and Skills Committee in January 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Allcock said: “I want to give this assurance - absolutely no stone will be left unturned. We will be inviting all involved to contribute to that report, parents, schools, governors, parent associations, officers and suppliers.”</p>

<p>Parents are asked to continue to refer any&nbsp;concerns about Home to School Transport to Richard Barker, Head of School Organisation, <a href=""mailto:richard.barker@brighton-hove.gov.uk"">richard.barker@brighton-hove.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;or 01273 290732.</p>

<p>The Pride Village Party has been happening in and around the St James’s Street area of the city for many years. Up until 2015 the event was not organised officially by either the council nor by Pride itself, instead, visitors independently congregated in the area attracted by the LGBTQ+ bars and clubs that exist there.</p>

<p>Since 2015 Pride organisers have managed the PVP and have put resources in place to manage the disruption to local people including additional security personnel, street cleaning and toilets. It is now a ticketed event limited to certain parts of St James’s Street and neighbouring roads.</p>

33521,"<p>A new approach to funding community and voluntary sector partnerships in the city benefitted nearly 36,000 residents in its first year.</p>

<p>The figures come from the first evaluation of the city’s Third Sector Commissioning (TSC) programme going to next week’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities Committee.</p>

<p>Twenty-six community and voluntary sector partnerships were awarded three year grants under the TSC programme in January 2017.</p>

<p>These grant agreements end next March and we’re now seeking the go ahead to begin consultation on updating the process for grant agreements starting from April 2020.</p>

<h3>New approach to awarding grants</h3>

<p>The TSC programme is a joint initiative between the council and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was introduced to make sure grant awards deliver maximum value for money, meet community need and support the city’s community and voluntary sector effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the first year, 35,959 residents benefitted from 144,660 sessions run under the programme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secure three-year funding has allowed organisations to plan and build their capability to deliver services focussing on people with multiple and complex needs.</p>

<p>They’ve also been able to add value, with the partnerships securing a further £6.27 million in funding in contracts and additional grant applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Supporting a stronger community and voluntary sector for the city</h3>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s great to see the positive impact this new approach to funding has had on the city’s community and voluntary sector – particularly how many residents have benefitted.</p>

<p>“The stability of the funding allows the sector to connect with communities and help many people who otherwise struggle to access services.</p>

<p>“It‘s given organisations the breathing space to develop new activity and secure additional funding, which has helped provide a stronger and more sustainable sector in the city.”</p>

<p>Sally Polanski, the Deputy Chief Executive of Amaze, a charity working with families of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The third sector commission has had a huge impact on the lives of parent carers and children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s enabled the provision of information, advice and support services and short breaks to local families, which has in turn increased their confidence and resilience, and strengthened their voice to shape the decisions that affect them.”</p>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said: “Holocaust Memorial Day is a time to remember the countless people affected by horrors almost beyond our comprehension.

<p>“We remember the devastated Jewish communities all across Europe, and all those destroyed by the hatred of the Holocaust. We remember the victims of genocides around the world since then. With the survivors and on behalf of the lost we say together ‘Never Again’.

33636,"<p>A new street fundraising agreement covering responsible face-to-face fundraising in Brighton &amp; Hove comes into force today (Monday 28 January).</p>

<p>The agreement between the council, the <a href=""https://www.brilliantbrighton.com/"">Brighton City Centre Business Improvement District (BID)</a> and the <a href=""https://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/"">Institute of Fundraising (IoF)</a> covers the whole&nbsp;city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agreement limits fundraising to a number of streets in the city centre and sets controls on when fundraising can take place, the number of fundraisers in a&nbsp;location and the frequency of visits a week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of the ‘Site Management Agreement’ (SMA) is to provide a balance between the duty of charities as they raise vital funds and the rights of the public not to be put under undue pressure to give.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""/sites/default/files/final_brighton_hove_sma_january_2019.pdf"">Read the Brighton &amp; Hove Site Management Agreement in full (PDF 816KB)</a></p>

<h2>Getting the balance right</h2>

<p>The decision to review the city’s SMA was made at the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=968&amp;MId=9226&amp;Ver=4"">Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee on 3&nbsp;December 2018</a> following concerns raised about street fundraising in George Street in Hove.</p>

<p>The new agreement means no street fundraising activity will take place in George Street.</p>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the council’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Street fundraising is an important way for charities to garner support, but we’ve listened to concerns that it has caused problems in some areas. This new site management agreement will help us get the balance right across the city.&nbsp;I‘m very pleased that we’ve been able to work with the Institute of Fundraisers and the Brighton BID to move so quickly on finding a solution.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gavin Stewart, Chief Executive of the Brighton BID said:</p>

<p>“It’s great to be working closely with partners to ensure that charities have the visibility they need to raise funds, while balancing the needs of businesses and the public. We have worked with the IoF for many years now and welcome this new site management agreement, which I’m sure will deliver a better city centre experience for all involved.”</p>

<p>Alex Xavier, Director of Membership, Compliance and Professional Development at the IoF, said:</p>

<p>“I’m pleased that the IoF is working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and the city centre Business Improvement District, Brilliant Brighton &nbsp;to further improve the level of excellent fundraising in the city centre.&nbsp;Face-to-face fundraising and the work charities do to reach supporters in the Brighton &amp; Hove area is vital to raise important funds for the causes the community cares about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The fundraisers you meet on the street are there to have a personal, one-to-one conversation with members of the public to make a connection with a charitable cause. However, it’s important that these encounters are regulated and are pleasant experiences for the public.”</p>

<h2>Street fundraising conditions</h2>

<p>As well as setting controls on street fundraising, the new SMA also reiterates the <a href=""https://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/code"">Code of Fundraising Practice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-07/Street-fundraising-rulebook%20(English).pdf"">Street Fundraising Rule Book</a>, which reinforce the rules that all fundraisers in the UK should follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IoF will support their members operating in Brighton &amp; Hove through a programme of spot checks and continued co-regulation with the council partner. Breaches of the conditions of the SMA attract penalty points under our penalties and sanctions regime.<br />

<p>The team takes council services out to local communities and every day is different, depending on what reports come in.</p>

<p>Noise prompts most complaints – whether it’s a one off event like a loud party or ongoing disturbance from noisy neighbours.</p>

<p>The field officers also respond to a wide variety of other issues, including for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bonfires</li>
	<li>Fly-tipping</li>
	<li>Barking dogs</li>
	<li>Illegal street trading</li>
	<li>Blocked drains</li>
	<li>Obstructions on pavements</li>
	<li>Motorbikes being ridden on footpaths</li>
</ul>

<p>They also help with monthly air monitoring checks at dozens of points across Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<h3>All in a day’s work</h3>

<p>Working closely with local people and problem solving is at the heart of the field officers’ work.</p>

<p>They link up with other council departments, and other organisations in the city, to get to the root of the problem and get things sorted.</p>

<p>Field officer, Teresa Reynolds, said: “There is no such thing as a typical day. We can go from serving an enforcement notice, or responding to a complaint about noise, to changing the tubes which are used to monitor air quality around the city.</p>

<p>“We need to be compassionate as well as enforcing regulations, it is a fine balance.”</p>

<p>She added: “Sometimes on a straightforward call we might discover other underlying issues. For example, a neighbour who is the subject of a noise complaint may be a vulnerable person who needs other support, and we can contact other services to help with that.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Making a difference</h3>

<p>The range of issues the team deals with is growing as the service develops and reacts to the needs of local communities.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of where their action is making a difference:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arranging for used needles and rubbish left in the street and on open ground to be removed and for cleaning to be carried out</li>
	<li>Tracking down a key holder for an empty property where an alarm had been ringing for more than 24 hours</li>
	<li>Taking enforcement action to clear large items of furniture which were blocking and creating a potential hazard for pedestrians</li>

33666,"<p>Historic Hove Museum will host the city’s next <a href=""http://www.techtakeback.co.uk/"">Tech-Takeback</a> event where people can drop off old and unwanted computers, phones and other gadgets.</p>

<p>Residents will be able to offload their unused and forgotten-about tech (working or broken) at the famous New Church Road landmark from Thursday 7 February to Saturday 9 February between 10am and 4.30pm.</p>

<h2>Tech-Takeback</h2>

<p>Tech-Takeback is a special ‘pop-up shop’ run by a team of dedicated IT and waste prevention experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can drop off unwanted tech, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PCs</li>
	<li>tablets</li>
	<li>laptops</li>
	<li>cables</li>
	<li>mobile phones</li>
	<li>hard drives</li>
	<li>USBs</li>
	<li>CDs</li>
	<li>DVDs</li>
	<li>games consoles</li>
	<li>printers</li>
	<li>digital cameras</li>
	<li>sat navs</li>
</ul>

<p>The items will then have any data erased for free by experts using a government compliant data-erasure service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pop-up shops are run by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, <a href=""https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/greencyclesussex"">Freegle</a>, the free online reuse network, circular economy environment specialists <a href=""http://www.soenecs.co.uk/"">SOENECS</a>, and computer data erasure experts <a href=""http://www.erasemydata.uk/"">EraseMyData</a>.</p>

<h2>Reused or recycled</h2>

<p>Once checked and any data is erased, the tech is given to charities to either use or distribute, given away for free on <a href=""https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/greencyclesussex"">Freegle</a>&nbsp;or to people less able to afford new tech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the equipment is beyond repair, it is dismantled, with its parts recycled.</p>

<p>A variety of local charities have benefited from Tech-Takeback, including the Sussex Homeless Support Charity, the Green Centre, The National Tech4Good Awards, The Bevy Community Pub, Artists at Boomtown Festival, Brighton Pride HQ, Screwed Sculptures, and the Library of Things.</p>

<p>We have also sent donated tech to the Little Trees Skills Training Centre in the Gambia, Africa.</p>

<h2>Saving the planet</h2>

<p>Electronic waste, or e-waste, is the fastest growing and one of the most dangerous rubbish streams affecting our planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The services Tech-Takeback provides, including giving the equipment a new lease of life or arranging responsible recycling, is a fantastic way of cutting back on e-waste pollution.</p>

<p>During the previous four Tech-Takeback events held in the city, residents have donated 6.5 tonnes, equivalent to 2000 bricks, of tech which massively helps in reducing the amount of E-waste going to landfill.</p>

<h2>The story so far</h2>

<p>Our four pop-up shops have been visited by more than 750 people and a total of 3645 items have been dropped off, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>692 mobile phones</li>
	<li>492 laptops and tablets</li>
	<li>209 computers</li>
	<li>232 hard drives</li>
	<li>276 USB memory sticks</li>
	<li>more than 350 boxes of cables</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr David Greenfield, co-founder of Tech-Takeback and managing director of SOENECS, said: “Hove Museum is a fantastic venue to hold our fifth pop-up shop.</p>

<p>“It’s the first one we’ve held in Hove so we’re hoping local residents will come out in force and drop off their old or unwanted tech.</p>

<p>“Tech-Takeback not only allows people to get rid of their old tech lying about in drawers, cupboards and lofts, when the items are dropped off, anything with data on it will be expertly and professionally wiped for free.</p>

<p>“Added to that, people will also be helping charities and others who cannot afford new tech, safe in the knowledge they are helping the planet.” &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What about businesses?</h2>

<p>Tech-Takeback is free to local residents. Businesses requiring Tech-Takeback’s data-erasure services should send an email to <a href=""mailto:techtakeback@gmail.com"">techtakeback@gmail.com</a> prior to attending.<br />

34841,"<p>Our women employees earn, on average, 7% more than men, the latest gender pay gap figures show.</p>

<p>Gender pay gap measures the difference between men’s and women’s average earnings across the organisation. Our latest figures reveal that the average, or mean, gender pay gap in hourly pay is -7.3% (up from -6.03%).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mean hourly rate for women working for the council is £15.06 (up from £14.88) and for men £14.03, the same as last year.</p>

<h1>What the figures show</h1>

<p>Women make up 60% of our workforce and more women have higher paid roles in the council. Of those earning basic salaries of £30,000 or more, 64% are women, compared to 36% men.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our workforce equalities data shows women generally out-performing men in recruitment processes and being more successful in getting promoted.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2018"">Nationally the median gender pay gap </a>shows men earning 17.9% more than women, reflecting the fact that more women work in lower-paid part-time jobs.*</p>

<p>Sixty-three per cent of women work part-time in the council, compared to 29% of men. Of those earning basic salaries less than £20,000, 51% are women and 49% men.</p>

<h1>Response to the gender pay gap results</h1>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, Chair of the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equality Committee said: “These figures help to highlight the work we are doing enabling women to develop their talents and progress within the council, but any pay gap is still inequality.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Over the next 12 months we will work to increase inclusion, equality and the diversity of our workforce. We want to position the council as a supportive and welcoming place to work for all our communities and gender forms part of our wider diversity agenda.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“As part of our staff programme ‘Our People Promise’ we are developing an action plan to better understand and address our gender pay gap and tackle areas of under-representation in the workforce.”</p>

<p>Family-friendly policies such as flexible working, career breaks, parental leave, discretionary leave and children’s vouchers have all helped to make the council an attractive place for women to work and develop a career. In 2017 98% of women returned to work following maternity leave.</p>

<h1>How we report the figures</h1>

<p>We are publishing the report to coincide with <a href=""https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Theme"">International Women’s Day</a> on <strong>8&nbsp;March</strong>. This year’s theme under the social media hashtag #BalanceforBetter is focusing on improving gender balance in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Figures shown for four pay band sections, known as quartiles, reflect the lowest paid up to the highest in Brighton &amp; Hove.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Gender pay gap in hourly pay is also calculated in the middle to produce a ‘median’ figure. In our case the median (middle) gender pay gap in hourly pay is -6.7%, again showing women earn more than men (slightly less than last year’s gap of -7.29%).&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Learn more about gender pay gap reporting</h1>

<p>The data is based on an annual ‘snapshot’ pay period of nearly 5,000 council employees (excluding school based staff) who were employed on 31 March 2018 and casuals paid during that month.</p>

<p>All employers with more than 250 employees must now publish their gender pay gap report annually. We published our gender pay gap for the first time last year.</p>

• &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Review potential barriers to recruitment to improve workforce diversity<br />

<h1>Committee decision</h1>

<p>Councillors endorsed the report that recommended the Pride Village Party not be moved and that the event continues to be run by the Brighton Pride Community Interest Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Tourism, Development and Culture Committee, Councillor Alan Robins, said: “It is clear from the responses we received from the public consultation on the Pride Village Party that the majority of people, including residents as well as the emergency services, want the event to continue on St James’s Street. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“The event has been well managed by Pride organisers, who since taking on the event in 2015 have put resources in place to manage the disruption to local people including additional security personnel, street cleaning and toilets.</p>

<p>“The annual Pride event is an important fixture in the city’s calendar and we look forward to the event returning again this August.”&nbsp;</p>
","The Pride Village Party will continue to be held in Brighton's St James's Street area following public consultation. Councillors discussed residents' views at the Tourism, Development & Culture Committee and expressed support for keeping the event in this area.","Community and equalities"

&nbsp;<br />
At the time of writing, forty-nine people have been killed and at least 20 have been wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch. The shootings took place around the time people were attending for Friday prayers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The statement says:</p>

<p>“We are deeply shocked and saddened by the acts of terror which have killed and injured so many innocent people whilst they worshiped.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“We send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives, those who have been injured, and all affected. We also send our best wishes for a fast and full recovery to everyone who was injured.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“We repeat our commitment to unity. We stand together; strong in compassion with people from all faiths and backgrounds. Division and hatred drives people into the ranks of those trying to recruit support to their terror campaigns. We will not let this happen.""</p>

<h3>Communities across Brighton &amp; Hove stand together as One Voice&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Following the incident at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in New Zealand early this morning, the city’s <a href=""http://www.safeinthecity.info/one-voice"">One Voice Partnership</a> strongly condemns this act of violence on innocent people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do not tolerate violence against innocent people, wherever it takes place. Together we speak with one voice against extremist perspectives and terrorist actions in the city and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The incident at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in New Zealand has deeply shocked and saddened us all. &nbsp;We send our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have lost their loved ones, those who have been injured, and all affected communities. &nbsp;Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We praise and reiterate the advice given by our Muslim community leaders; ‘please don’t watch the distressing video and importantly please do not share the manifesto and other information as sharing would also assist in promoting the attackers message further and promoting hate further’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Brighton &amp; Hove One Voice Partnership reaffirms that communities, council and police stand together in solidarity with our Muslim communities following the tragic incident in Christchurch, New Zealand.&nbsp;We stand firm that these acts of violence, Islamophobia and hate must not go any further. We stand together to counter the threat from the far right. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s now even more important for all our communities to demonstrate that we will not let any terrorist action divide us and continue our great tradition of unity and respect for all. We must look out and care for each other and ensure that individuals, communities and places of worship are not singled out in our city.</p>

<p>One Voice Partnership urges all our communities to stand together as one to stop these acts of violence and hatred from carrying on further and work together to stop Islamophobia, racist and other hate incidents.</p>

35201,"<p>The Safer Communities Team and the Youth Offending Service have been awarded the <a href=""https://restorativejustice.org.uk/restorative-service-quality-mark"">Restorative Service Quality Mark</a> (RSQM) by the <a href=""https://restorativejustice.org.uk/"">Restorative Justice Council</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restorative practice is a way of bringing people involved in conflict into direct or indirect communication to repair the harm caused by the conflict and to collectively find a way forward. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>A restorative city</h2>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove committed to becoming a ‘restorative city’ in 2015, led by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Sussex Police and the Office of the Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The practice seeks to help people understand the impact of their behaviour and make amends for it. It is most commonly used within criminal and youth justice in the UK bringing together victims of crime with offenders. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The council’s Safer Communities Team has led this work in partnership with the Youth Offending Service.&nbsp;Both services work with people affected by crime, anti-social behaviour and hate incidents and the people responsible for this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How it helps</h2>

<p>Restorative practice has helped significantly reduce the number of young people entering the criminal justice system through diversionary activities such as reparation or face-to-face meetings between victims and the people responsible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Safer Communities Team take the approach to support people involved in neighbour disputes, anti-social behaviour, bullying in schools and hate incidents throughout the city. They also work with housing providers to help reduce the number of abandonments and evictions that can happen if issues are not addressed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Emma Daniel, chair of the council’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said:&nbsp;“It’s great news that we have achieved the RSQM. We have made significant progress in developing Brighton &amp; Hove as a restorative city and it’s proved to be a really valuable way to resolve disputes.</p>

<p>“The RSQM is a badge of quality that guarantees that a service is consistently offering safe and effective restorative practice in our city.”</p>

35436,"<p>EU citizens in Brighton &amp; Hove will start to see and hear outdoor, radio and TV advertising promoting the EU Settlement Scheme this week ahead of the scheme’s full launch on Saturday 30 March. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The adverts encourage EU citizens and their family members to apply for the <a href=""https://eucitizensrights.campaign.gov.uk/"">EU Settlement </a><a href=""https://eucitizensrights.campaign.gov.uk/"">Scheme</a>, and will point towards official sources of information on GOV.UK (the government's website).</p>

<h2>Secure your rights - apply to the scheme</h2>

<p>To secure your rights, EU citizens and their family members will need to go through a simple digital application process.</p>

<p>The application process aims to be as quick and user-friendly as possible and existing government data will be used to reduce the amount of evidence EU citizens will need to provide.</p>

<p>The application process checks three basic principles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>proof of identity</li>
	<li>proof of UK residence</li>
	<li>criminal convictions</li>
</ul>

<p>In line with the draft Withdrawal Agreement, EU citizens and their family members will be able to apply until 30 June 2021 and their rights will remain unchanged until then.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://eucitizensrights.campaign.gov.uk/"">Learn more about the application process</a></p>

35661,"<p>Following a fantastic take-up last year, badges helping raise awareness that you can’t assume someone’s gender identity and the pronouns they use will be available again across the city from Monday 1 April.</p>

<p>The badges are part of a campaign to raise awareness of trans and non-binary people to mark Trans Day of Visibility on 31 March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They&nbsp;are being made available to any council and partner organisation staff, as well as members of the public, who want to take part. Wearing the badges is, of course, voluntary.</p>

<h2>Where to get your badge</h2>

<p>You can pick up one of the badges at any of the city’s libraries, the council customer service centres at Bartholomew House and Hove Town Hall, the receptions at Brighton Town Hall, Hove Town Hall and Portslade Town Hall, or in Brighton Museum, Hove Museum and the Register Office in Brighton Town Hall.</p>

<p>The badges available will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>She, her, hers</li>
	<li>He, him, his</li>
	<li>They, them, theirs</li>
	<li>Please use my name</li>
	<li>Blank, for the wearer to fill in</li>
	<li>Trans Ally</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt=""MyPronounsAre badges"" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""525"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/thumb-mypronounsare.jpg"" width=""700"" /></p>

<p>This year, we’re also making a number of stickers available in some of the city’s secondary schools and further education colleges for any young people who want to show their support. The stickers read:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Trans Day of Visibility</li>
	<li>Respect my pronouns, respect me</li>
	<li>Gender is a spectrum</li>
	<li>Trans Ally</li>
	<li>My pronouns matter</li>
</ul>

<p>The campaign has been put together by the council with support and involvement from local LGBT+ community groups, including The Clare Project, Trans Alliance, Allsorts Youth Project, the council’s LGBT Workers Forum, local NHS trusts, NHS Eastbourne, Hailsham and Seaford Clinical Commissioning Group, East Sussex Fire &amp; Rescue, University of Brighton, University of Sussex, and Sussex Police.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Read the badge, respect people</h2>

<p>The message of the campaign is to read the badge and respect people. It’s that easy.</p>

<p>We all define our own gender and we should respect other people’s identities, and rights.</p>

<p>While there is more freedom and safety to be ourselves, there’s still more to do.</p>

<p>Who a person is may not match what you expect and may not be defined easily. If someone’s pronouns differ from what you assume, it’s for you to adapt and it’s okay to ask.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Our trans and non-binary inclusive approach</h2>

<p>The initiative follows the city’s <a href=""https://www.bhconnected.org.uk/sites/bhconnected/files/Brighton%20%26%20Hove%20Trans%20Needs%20Assessment%202015.pdf"">Trans Needs Assessment</a> and Trans Equality Scrutiny group which identified the trans and non-binary community as a vulnerable group and highlighted the need to remove the stigma and build relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re proud of being a diverse city, and the council is committed to equality and inclusion for all people including our trans and non-binary residents.</p>

<p>We are aware of an ongoing interest in our trans and non-binary inclusive approach. We know from a range of evidence that gender is more complicated than is traditionally recognised.</p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/council-and-democracy/equality/our-equality-and-inclusion-policy-statement-and-strategy"">equality and inclusion strategy</a> rightly supports those who are experiencing greatest disadvantage. We will work with people to reduce their exclusion and ensure equality of opportunity. We aim to do this in partnership with national and local organisations and communities.</p>

37981,"<p>From welcoming visitors to the city, looking after our gardens and open spaces and leading healthwalks, to helping people get online, representing tenant groups and supporting charities and hospitals, volunteers bring enormous benefits to the city.</p>

<p>Volunteering also brings its own reward. It increases people’s wellbeing and connects them to activities and communities in their local areas. It also provides people with new skills and experience.</p>

<h2>Celebrating volunteers</h2>

<p>To mark this year’s Volunteers Week (1-7 June), 500 of the city’s volunteers have been invited to a celebration at the American Express Community Stadium taking place later this month.</p>

<p>The celebration is being run in partnership with&nbsp;American Express&nbsp;and the city's&nbsp;community &amp; voluntary sector.</p>

<p>Councillor Nancy Platts, the Leader of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, said: “I’d like to thank you to everyone who volunteers in Brighton &amp; Hove.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Some residents are giving up their time to help regularly at food banks, or to befriend those who would otherwise be extremely isolated, or to help support park runs and many other community events, or to join in with a litter-picking team. There are even residents who are volunteer sheep-lookerers, watching over grazing livestock!&nbsp;</p>

<p>“By doing all this, residents are providing vital support, and contributing a great deal to life in the city and our general health and wellbeing. This celebration is a small token of our appreciation for the contribution of our volunteers, and I really hope it is a fantastic event.”</p>

<h2>The value of volunteering</h2>

<p>According to national figures, volunteering contributed an estimated £22.6 billion&nbsp;to the UK economy in 2015. In 2017/18, 20.1 million people in the UK volunteered formally at least once a year and 11.8 million people did so at least once a month.</p>

<p>‘Wanting to do good’ is the most common motivation to volunteer. In 2017/18, 46% of people said that they volunteer to improve things and help others.</p>

38631,"<p>Cllr Nancy Platts, leader of the council, said:&nbsp;“I am horrified to hear about a camel being used as an attraction at the Land Beyond Festival in the city. There was no mention of this on the event plan submitted to the council by the event organisers and if the organisers think this is an acceptable way to behave, then they can forget about coming back to Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>“I understand the animal warden team was made aware of the festival’s plans at very short notice when alerted by another local authority. Every effort was made to check the animal’s welfare, this was understandably the animal warden team’s priority. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“As landlords of the park where the event took place, we have the right to refuse permission. This is what should have been done, even at the late stage we became aware of the plans.</p>

<p>""I will personally ensure procedures are tightened to prevent a similar situation happening in the future.” &nbsp;</p>

<h2>‘You, me and those who came before’</h2>

<p>The theme of Refugee Week 2019, ‘You, me and those who came before’, is an invitation to explore the lives of refugees – and those who have welcomed them – throughout the generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The UN report that the world is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. An unprecedented 68.5 million people around the world have been forced from home. Among them are nearly 25.4 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.</p>

<p>Councillor Nancy Platts, leader of the council, said:&nbsp;“It must be a terrifying experience to be forced to flee your home and end up in a foreign country in need of a new home, a new job and to have to do it all in a new language.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’m proud that the people of our city have extended the hand of friendship to refugees and become a City of Sanctuary.</p>

<p>“We have a very active community of organisations who work with us to provide a culture of welcome in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>“Brighton Table Tennis Club is one of the many groups that have created an inclusive place in the city. It is the UK’s first Sports Club of Sanctuary and <a href=""https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2018/4/5ae199de4/bringing-hope-to-the-table.html"">has been highlighted by the UN refugee agency for its&nbsp;work</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Looking for landlords</h2>

<p>The council is looking for more private sector landlords to work with us to provide homes for some of the world’s most vulnerable refugees.</p>

<p>The city has already taken 13 Syrian households as part of the national Vulnerable Person’s Resettlement Scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The government funds local authorities for refugees arriving here through this scheme, which pays to support them to settle in a new country, including helping the children to settle in local schools.</p>

<p>If any landlords would like to find out more about helping to resettle refugees, please email <a href=""mailto:refugeehelp@brighton-hove.gov.uk"">refugeehelp@brighton-hove.gov.uk</a> or call 01273 291248.</p>

39591,"<p>An event to mark Windrush Day was held at Brooke Mead seniors housing scheme in Brighton.</p>

<p>Residents from council-run seniors housing schemes across the city took part in the event held ahead of National Windrush Day on 22 June.</p>

<p>Actor and playwright Victor Richards performed ‘Streets Paved with Gold’, a play based on the arrival of the Empire Windrush, which brought 492 people from the Caribbean in 1948. The performance was followed by a Caribbean buffet for residents.</p>

<p>The event was organised to celebrate and support diversity in our seniors housing schemes.</p>

<p>Council leader, Councillor Nancy Platts, said: “The Windrush generation changed our country for the better, bringing a new diversity to British social, cultural and political life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This was not without hardship for those who arrived 70 years ago and even recent treatment of the Windrush generation has been shockingly callous. That must not continue. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who came here and made their lives in our country.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“In Brighton &amp; Hove, we’re a city of sanctuary, a proud statement of commitment to welcoming people from around the world.”</p>

<h2>The Windrush Generation</h2>

<p>Windrush Day marks the anniversary of the docking of MV Empire Windrush at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948. The arrival of the Empire Windrush over 70 years ago marked a seminal moment in Britain’s history and has come to represent the rich diversity of this nation.</p>

<p>The people who arrived on the Empire Windrush, their descendants and those who followed them have made and continue to make an enormous contribution to Britain, not just in the vital work of rebuilding the country and public services following World War Two, but in enriching our shared social, economic, cultural and religious life.</p>

40181,"<p>Cllr Kate Knight, Committee Chair for the council’s Neighbourhoods, Inclusion,&nbsp;Communities &amp; Equalities (NICE) committee has today written an open letter to the city’s Community and Voluntary Sector (CSV) sharing with them that the committee will consider the original bidding timetable and process for the Third Sector Commissioning Prospectus.</p>

<p>The open letter reads:</p>

<p>“Since I last wrote to you on 19 June when I explained that I wanted to briefly pause the Third Sector Commissioning Prospectus process, I have further listened to the Community and Voluntary Sector (CSV); and spoken with other Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities (NICE) committee members.</p>

<p>“I now feel a pause on the commission is not the best way forward and at the special meeting of the NICE Committee taking place on 16 July; the committee will be asked to consider the original proposal and timetable.</p>

<p>“As a new councillor and Chair of the committee, my initial feeling was that it was important to take time to familiarise myself with the work of the community and voluntary sector (CVS). I&nbsp;also wanted to ensure that the commission process was as transparent as possible and, really importantly, I had wanted to understand it from the view point of grassroots organisations and groups.</p>

<p>“I have since been able to listen to different perspectives about the process and the work undertaken in collaboration with the sector on the Commission and it has become clear that not everyone shares my view that a short pause would have been desirable.</p>

<p>“I’m also aware that some degree of anxiety and uncertainty has been created about the Commission, despite assurances about our commitment to our partners and to funding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This was never our intention. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are committed to being an administration that listens and that works in partnership with those that also want the best for the city, and it is with these principles in mind that we are bringing the original report back to the NICE committee for consideration.”</p>

<p>The special meeting of the NICE committee takes place at 5pm&nbsp;on Tuesday 16 July at Hove Town Hall.</p>

40201,"<p>The signs of criminal and sexual exploitation are being highlighted to help people know what to look for and how to help. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Children, young people and vulnerable adults are at risk of exploitation from criminal groups and drug dealers. Incidents of exploitation are on the rise across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Action is being taken in Brighton &amp; Hove by the council, Sussex Police and other partners to keep people safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The city’s community safety partnership is working together to raise awareness of the signs of exploitation, so it can be spotted and prevented at an early stage.</p>

<h2>Week of action</h2>

<p>This June, a ‘Spot the Signs’ campaign launched in the city. Sussex Police, East Sussex Fire &amp; Rescue Service, the council and community organisations and voluntary organisations took part in a week of activities including: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Multi-agency visits to hotels and bed &amp; breakfasts to educate around the signs of exploitation.</li>
	<li>Welfare visits by police officers to the homes of vulnerable people ‘cuckooed’ by out-of-county drug dealers&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Visits by PCSOs to neighbouring addresses to gather intelligence and educate around spotting the signs</li>
	<li>Pop-up Premier League Kicks football sessions on The Level.</li>
	<li>Drop-ins by Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and community workers at a range of neighbourhood events</li>
	<li>An event at Falmer Stadium bringing people who live, work or socialise together to look at how the city can work together to tackle these issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Chief Superintendent of Brighton &amp; Hove Police, Nick May, said: “This joint week of action with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and other partners has proved an effective way to raise awareness of exploitation and how the public can to help prevent it.</p>

<p>“By combining our powers, we were able to reach more deeply into the community to help disrupt county lines activity, creating a hostile environment for gangs from bigger cities who exploit vulnerable people to carry out drug dealing, violent crime and criminal &amp; sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>“As well as visiting 16 addresses where vulnerable people are known to be targeted by criminal ‘cuckoos’, we also made awareness-raising visits to 134 neighbouring addresses, gathering vital intelligence.</p>

<p>“We also visited more than 40 hotels, with licensing and Fire &amp; Rescue officers in some cases, to brief management on how to detect and prevent criminal and sexual exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“During a visit to a budget hotel, a knife and taser were recovered and an arrest for serious sexual assault was also made during patrol between cuckooing addresses.</p>

<p>“We look forward to continuing to work closely with the community safety partnership to reinforce this preventative approach.”</p>

<p>Councillor Kate Knight, chair of the council’s Neighbourhoods Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said: “It’s very important that people are aware that children and vulnerable people are being exploited in Brighton &amp; Hove by dealers involved in drug crime.</p>

<p>“Children and vulnerable people who get drawn into this are the victims of crime. If you have any concerns about a young or vulnerable person in your neighbourhood, please do report them to make sure they can get the help they need.”</p>

<h2>Spotting the signs</h2>

<p><img alt=""Spot the signs graphic"" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""253"" src=""/sites/default/files/Spot-the-signs-news-graphic.png"" width=""450"" /></p>

<p>Recognising the signs of exploitation at an early stage is key to stopping it happening, especially when those involved are not always aware they are being badly used. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the signs of exploitation include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unexplained money, clothes or mobile phones</li>
	<li>Significant changes in emotional wellbeing</li>
	<li>Relationships with older or controlling people&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Suspicion of self-harm, physical assault or unexplained injuries</li>
</ul>

40216,"<p>The city’s third Disability Pride, a celebration for and of disabled people, takes place this Sunday (14 July) on Hove Lawns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day begins with a short parade led by Unified Rhythm,&nbsp;starting at 11.30am along the promenade from the British Airways i360 to the Peace Statue at Hove Lawns. Everyone is invited to join in the parade.</p>

<p>Celebrations continue until 6pm on Hove Lawns with live music, speakers, performances, art and numerous stalls, with entrance by the Peace Statue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disabled people are leading events throughout the day across the line up.</p>

<h2>Why Disability Pride?</h2>

<p>The celebration was the first of its kind in the UK and is named Disability Pride to link to a wider international movement. It is run by a community-based group with the aim of being all inclusive while celebrating the diversity and value of all disabled people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Brighton &amp; Hove event was founded by local resident Jenny Skelton after one of her daughters suffered an incident of disability discrimination.</p>

<p>Jenny explained: “After a Facebook post I wrote about the discrimination went viral, 100s of disabled people wrote to me to share similar experiences, and I decided I had to do something.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I held an open meeting and invited disabled people to tell me what they would like Disability Pride in the city to include and then got together a committee of disabled people to organise the first event in 2017.”</p>

<p>Last year’s celebration welcomed 3,000 disabled people and their families and friends.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the impact Disability Pride has made in the city, Jenny said: “I think it’s slightly easier for disabled people than it was when the first Disability Pride took place. I do think that Brighton &amp; Hove is an accepting and inclusive city overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“However, there is still much to be done to combat disability discrimination, particularly with hidden disabilities. People write to me every day to tell me about their experiences.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>#ComingOutAsDisabled</h2>

<p>Disability Pride will also see the launch of <a href=""http://www.disabilitypridebrighton.com/comingoutasdisabled/"">new campaign hashtags #ComingOutAsDisabled and #COAD</a> highlighting acceptance of people ‘coming out’ as disabled.</p>

<p>Jenny said: “Many disabled people I know have experienced discrimination in both their working lives and their day-to-day lives. People should be accepted as exactly who they are - just a natural part of human diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“One in four employers have admitted they would be reluctant to employ a disabled person but, as 19% of working age people are disabled, it doesn’t bode well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We will have a fun but serious #ComingOutAsDisabled selfie frame at Disability Pride this year for people to use if they wish!”</p>

<h2>All welcome!</h2>

<p>Councillor Kate Knight, chair of the council’s Neighbourhoods Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee, said: “I’m really proud that Brighton &amp; Hove was the first Disability Pride in the UK and I’d like to thank everyone who’s played a part in making it such a success.</p>

<p>“It’s a fantastic way to recognise and celebrate the contribution made by the disabled community, as well as raising awareness of disability discrimination. I hope this year’s celebration proves to be the biggest and best so far.”</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Buses and Community Transport will be running a free shuttle bus every 20 minutes from Brighton Station to Disability Pride. The shuttle bus will start from 9.30am from Brighton Station, with &nbsp;the last bus leaving Hove Lawns at 7.35pm.</p>

40341,"<p>The main events in the city’s seventh <a href=""https://transpridebrighton.org/"">Trans Pride</a> take place this Saturday (20 July).</p>

<p>The day begins with a protest march starting from the Marlborough Pub &amp; Theatre in Prince’s Street at 12 noon, followed by an programme of&nbsp;events&nbsp;in Brunswick Square Gardens running from 1pm to 6pm.</p>

<p>Members of the council’s LGBTQ Workers Forum will be taking part in the march to show solidarity with Trans &amp; Non-Binary communities in the city and council colleagues.</p>

<h2>About Trans Pride</h2>

<p>Trans Pride has been running in Brighton &amp; Hove since 2013, and is the biggest event of its kind in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event seeks to show the Trans &amp; Non-Binary community in all its joyous glory and celebrate transgender people as artists, musicians, writers, performers, as well as trans people as everyday people just getting on with their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is run by a grass-roots, community-led organisation staffed entirely by unpaid volunteers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender rights have continued to have a huge amount of visibility in the last year. Unfortunately, some of this has been negative and often damagingly misleading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=""https://transpridebrighton.org/events/"">See the full programme of Trans Pride 2019 events</a></p>

<h2>An event to be proud of</h2>

<p>Councillor Amanda Grimshaw, the council’s lead member for equalities, said: “From personal experience, I know there is still a lot of work to be done on equality and inclusion issues for Trans &amp; Non-Binary people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are fully committed to supporting Trans &amp; Non-Binary community groups in the city and it’s an area I am really passionate about.</p>

<p>“I have a close friend who is Trans and, from my time at Brighton Museum, I saw the incredible impact the <a href=""https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/brighton/exhibitions-displays/the-museum-of-transology/"">Museum of Transology exhibition</a> had on 100s of visitors.</p>

<p>“There is still too much prejudice and a small minority of people promoting anti-trans agenda and misinformation about support organisations across the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Trans Pride is a crucial way to raise awareness of the issues Trans &amp; Non-Binary people face and a fantastic way to show our support. My friend tells me it’s the one day she is looked at for all the right reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I am also delighted to welcome Trans &amp; Non-Binary visitors from across the country coming to join in Brighton &amp; Hove’s Trans Pride events and celebrations.”</p>

<h2>Have a safe and happy Trans Pride</h2>

<h2>Our trans and non-binary inclusive approach</h2>

<p>We’re proud of being a diverse city, and the council is committed to equality and inclusion for all people including our Trans &amp; Non-Binary residents.</p>

<p>The city’s <a href=""https://www.bhconnected.org.uk/sites/bhconnected/files/Brighton%20%26%20Hove%20Trans%20Needs%20Assessment%202015.pdf"">Trans Needs Assessment</a> and Trans Equality Scrutiny group which identified the Trans &amp;&nbsp;Non-Binary community as a vulnerable group and highlighted the need to remove the stigma and build relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are aware of an ongoing interest in our Trans &amp; Non-Binary inclusive approach. We know from a range of evidence that gender is more complicated than is traditionally recognised.</p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/council-and-democracy/equality/our-equality-and-inclusion-policy-statement-and-strategy"">equality and inclusion strategy</a> rightly supports those who are experiencing greatest disadvantage.

40486,"<p>Community and voluntary organisations in Brighton &amp; Hove contribute extensive economic, as well as social and environmental value to the city.</p>

<p>That’s the main finding in <a href=""https://bhcommunityworks.org.uk/voluntary-sector/brighton-and-hove/research/"">Taking Account &nbsp;4</a> – the latest report detailing the impact of third sector organisations in Brighton &amp; Hove produced by local charity <a href=""https://bhcommunityworks.org.uk/"">Community Works</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Other key findings in the report include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Community, collaboration, co-production, activism, diversity and inclusion are core principles at the bedrock of the sector.</li>
	<li>Working together across sectors is important but the independence of the third sector is essential. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>While overall the sector has demonstrated resilience, some areas and fields of work have been disproportionately affected by funding cuts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Positive impacts</h2>

<p>Nancy Platts, Leader of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, said: “From grassroots community groups to medium and large voluntary organisations, they all play a critical role in the health and wellbeing of our residents, our environment and our city. This report is a timely reminder of just how important they are.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>From the thousands of hours of volunteering and the range of services provided in the city, the report shows the changes many organisations have had to make in recent years.</p>

<p>The results show that organisations have improved how they measure the value of the services to show their impact to funders. While public sector funding has decreased significantly, grassroots groups continue to have huge positive impacts on people’s day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Local HIV support charity acts on loneliness and increases demand</h2>

<p>An example is drawn from one of the case study organisations – the multi-award winning <a href=""http://www.lunchpositive.org"">Lunch Positive</a>.</p>

<p>Lunch Positive has strengthened its focus on reducing social isolation and bringing people together for mutual support, rather than the delivery of specific health initiatives.</p>

<p>This largely relates to a shift in focus recognising the impact that loneliness has on health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The organisation achieves the same health outcomes, but the focus on bringing people together to support each other means the project reaches a wider group of people. This includes those who don’t usually engage who are often those with more complex needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Free tools for reporting in Brighton &amp; Hove</h2>

<p>Community Works has also published accompanying reports for local third sector organisations to use as tools. They include statistics for organisations to use to support funding bids and reporting.</p>

<p>This research has taken place at five-year intervals since 2003, so is a useful tool both to see the current situation, as well as looking back to how the community and voluntary sector used to look.</p>

<p>Angie Greany, lead partner in the Taking Account 4 survey from Community Works, said: “Our enormous thanks to all the organisations that took part across the city. This report celebrates their achievements and recognises the challenges they are working with.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>About Community Works</h2>

<p><a href=""https://bhcommunityworks.org.uk/"">Community Works</a> values voluntary and community action and believes it makes society and local areas better. To achieve this they create the support and networks that help people and organisations to use their time, expertise and energy effectively.</p>

<h2>50 years since the Stonewall riots</h2>

<p>2019 marks 50 years since the Stonewall riots that took place, marking half a century of activism and achievements in the fight for equality and inclusion for LGBTQ+ people.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Pride is widely recognised as one of the largest and most popular in the country.&nbsp;As usual our council’s LGBTQ+ Workers Forum are organising their walking entry in the <a href=""https://www.brighton-pride.org/pride-parade/"">Pride Community Parade</a>, joining groups from across the city on the march from Hove Lawns to Preston Park.</p>

<h2>The struggle for equality continues</h2>

<p>Cllr Amanda Grimshaw, lead for equalities, said: “Relentless action and many brave individuals have forced the pace of change internationally, here in the UK, and more locally in our city - defying the entrenched positions of state and society to make things better.</p>

<p>“The struggle for equality continues and every achievement is hard won. Change has been achieved through communities recognising we have more in common than divides us.”</p>

<h2>A more inclusive Pride flag</h2>

<p>We will be&nbsp;one of the first&nbsp;councils to display&nbsp;the new inclusive Pride flag, designed to recognise that the modern LGBTQ+ movement began through the support of and leadership of Black Trans Women, including Marsha P Johnson. It will be carried by the LGBTQ+ Workers Forum in the Community Parade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flag design reflects the appalling fact that Trans, Black and Ethnic Minority LGBTQ+ people experience higher rates of murder, other types of transphobia, homophobia and racism. The colourful design symbolises how everyone has many parts to their identity and that we should all work&nbsp;towards a world without prejudice and discrimination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beach is full. People are being asked to stay away from the seafront. The tide is still coming in at this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agencies are working together to manage the crowds and encourage people away from the beach. The situation&nbsp;will continue to be monitored&nbsp;overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Information issued at 11.20pm Saturday 3 August</strong></h3>

<p>The seafront was very crowded at around 10pm. High tides also limited space on the beach.</p>

<p>HM Coastguard advised people to stay away from the seafront.</p>

<p>At the same time, PVP (Pride’s Park Village Party) reached capacity and no more people were allowed in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pride, the council and partner agencies shared the advice to stay away from the seafront and not to go to PVP.&nbsp;</p>

40626,"<p>The annual LGBTQ+ Brighton Pride Community Parade marched through the city on Saturday morning – a colourful celebration with a purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People from local organisations, charities, agencies and businesses joined in the spectacular event. There were about 1500 participants representing 147 different LGBTQ+ groups.</p>

<p>The parade took four hours to wind its way from Hove Lawns to Preston Park. Thousands of people turned out to line the route and show support for all those taking part.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Generations of love</h2>

<p>Amid the happy and joyous occasion, the right to equality and respect was also a key focus - clearly displayed on banners and many participants’ choice of outfits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2019 parade commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall Inn uprising in New York. Stonewall was the moment that ignited the Pride movement. The theme “Generations of Love – Celebrating 50 years of campaigning with Pride” also recognised the ongoing campaigning work for equal rights.</p>

<p>Many participants, including the council’s LGBTQ+ Workers Forum, chose Stonewall as the inspiration for their sections of the parade.</p>

<p>We’ve put together a montage of photos taken during the parade:&nbsp;<br />

33326,"<p>Nine out of ten people living in Brighton &amp; Hove have told researchers that they’re the most satisfied with the city as a place to live that they’ve been for five years.</p>

<p>The annual City Tracker resident satisfaction survey shows that the city’s residents are far more likely than people living elsewhere in the country to feel a sense of belonging to their local neighborhood. They also strongly believe that their community is a place where people from different backgrounds can thrive.</p>

<p>And, in contrast with the rest of the country, people living in Brighton &amp; Hove are more positive about how their local area has improved.</p>

<h2>What are people saying they like about the city?</h2>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>The city’s schools are supported by local residents, backing up Ofsted’s view that all children in the city can attend a good secondary school.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>The city’s cultural offer is also a big draw. 2018 saw the highest level of attendance at cultural events since the survey began, with the numbers of people going to libraries, museums and galleries exceeding national averages.</p>

<h3>The council</h3>

<p>More residents trust the council and believe the council acts on their concerns compared with UK residents as a whole. However, overall satisfaction with the council has dropped from last year’s five-year high which is consistent with most other councils’ results according to the <a href=""https://www.local.gov.uk/polling-resident-satisfaction-councils-october-2018"">Local Government Association’s national resident satisfaction report</a>.</p>

<h2>What needs to get better?</h2>

<p>When asked what people would change about the city, residents overwhelmingly told researchers “clean up the city” and “improve the general appearance”. Housing, homes and homelessness was second on the priority list.</p>

<h2>Council Leader’s response</h2>

<p>Speaking about the survey results Council Leader, Cllr Dan Yates, said he thought the results were understandable at a local level but were also the first real reflection of the impact of national cuts on local government funding which are being felt across the country. He said:</p>

<p>“We had one of the hottest summers on record this year, which was great for most of us, but the lack of rain meant all councils struggled to keep their streets clean. It’s completely understandable that the streets and the number of missed rubbish collections during the summer contributed to people saying they want a cleaner city.</p>

<p>“Councils have enormous responsibilities; we protect and indeed save lives every day. Much of this work goes unrecognised through our less visible services which most of us are fortunate enough not to come into contact with. Services like adult social care and child protection.</p>

<p>“I’m incredibly proud that over the last four years this council has been able to shield the city from a lot of the budget reductions. We’ve protected our most vulnerable residents but it has come at a cost, and sadly most of us can now see the impact of the savings on our more visible services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“However I’m not in public office to simply manage decline. We’re developing innovative approaches to delivering services and we’re seeing improvements and differences being made to people’s lives every day. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“For example; the new Field Officer Team, bringing council services out to the city’s communities, seven days a week using mobile technology to report and quickly sort issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“And the actions and initiatives taking place through the City Environment Modernisation Programme which sees more support for the waste and recycling service and the launch of new systems and processes to enable customers to contact Cityclean effortlessly and for staff to respond quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>“Our new approach to graffiti will also start making a real difference to the city’s appearance too.”</p>

<h2>What is the City Tracker Survey?</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.bhconnected.org.uk/"">Brighton &amp; Hove Connected</a> - the city’s Local Strategic Partnership - commissioned Infocorp Ltd to carry out the 2018 annual City Tracker survey of the city’s residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survey took place from 17 September to 9 November 2018. It covers Brighton &amp; Hove’s adult population aged 18 and above and its objective is to find out what residents think of Brighton &amp; Hove as a place to live.</p>

	<li>Councillors will soon meet to decide funding for more than 700 council services and the council tax rate for the year ahead</li>
	<li>Budget proposals include an increase of council tax of 2.99%</li>
	<li>All current councillors can debate and vote on the budget proposals on Thursday 28 February</li>
</ul>

<h2>Budget decision time</h2>

<p>The council’s biggest annual financial decision will be made later this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillors will meet at Hove Town Hall to decide the council budget for the financial year starting on 1 April.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council budget funds more than 700 services for people living and working in Brighton &amp; Hove. It currently costs just under £2.1 million every day to run our services.</p>

<p>The budget proposals for the year ahead continue to look at ways to invest in the city amid wide ranging reductions in government funding. The impact of reducing government grants on local councils has been widely reported across the country.</p>

<p>Cllr Dan Yates, leader of the council, said: “We knew when we took over responsibility for the council that there were tough times ahead. Over the last four years we’ve taken the difficult decisions required to make sure we have protected services for the most vulnerable in the city.</p>

<p>“These proposals reflect a clear grasp of the financial situation combined with a determination to reinvest in key services. It’s an ongoing challenge to meet increasing demand for services as costs rise and funding falls.”</p>

<h3>Background to the budget 2019/20</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The budget proposals for 2019/20 are the final stage in our four year budget plan.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Total savings of around £69 million will have been delivered over the four year period to provide the necessary re-investment in services alongside taxation increases.</li>
	<li>Budget Proposals for 2019/20 include:</li>
	<li>The proposals include recommendations to invest in priority services, including adult social care, children’s social care and other services to combat inequality.</li>
	<li>Children’s Social Care: A total of £54million&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adult Social Care including Learning Disability Services: A total of £92.6million</li>
	<li>Field Officer Service, providing help across the city: A total of £312,000</li>
	<li>Homelessness and rough sleeping services: For the year ahead £10.6million is proposed for these services. This includes £250,000 for an all year round night shelter for rough sleepers and £250,000 to expand options to support people in emergency and temporary accommodation.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<h3>Council tax</h3>

<p>In common with many local authorities, the budget proposals for 2019/20 require an increase of council tax contributions to&nbsp;the council of 2.99%, largely in light of the increasing demand for social care and reducing grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This would mean the average Band D Council Tax contribution to the council would rise by £46.38 to £1,595.45 in 2019/20.<br />
<br />
The full amount for the average Band D Council tax for 2019/20 will be £1,879.03 (a rise of £73.05 from the year before). This includes £189.91&nbsp;for the Sussex Police &amp; Crime Commissioner and £ 93.67 for the East Sussex Fire Authority.</p>

<p>The budget will be debated by all councillors on Thursday 28 February at Hove Town Hall. At the meeting, opposition councillors present and debate any amendments to the proposals they choose to submit.</p>

<p>The current political leadership arrangements continue for now. Under our constitution, any change in leadership can only take effect following a decision at a meeting of the Full Council when all currently elected councillors agree who forms the administration and who is voted to be Leader of the Council. Councillors decide whether and at which meeting the business is discussed.</p>

<p>Subject to the will of councillors, the day to day operation of services to the public will remain unchanged in the short term. Council officers will continue to use their delegated powers to ensure a consistent service.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Brighton &amp; Hove City Council budget for 2019/20 has been set</li>
	<li>Councillors decided how to allocate more than £900million&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The budget includes an increase of the council’s element of council tax of 2.99 per cent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Priorities</h2>

<p>The Brighton &amp; Hove City Council budget for 2019/20 has been set at Budget Council today (Thursday 28 February).</p>

<p>The council provides more than 700 services residents see or use every day. It currently costs just under £2.1 million to run our council services every day.</p>

<p><strong>This budget has prioritised:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Children’s Services: A total of £54million, including £46.2m for children’s social care&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Adult Social Care including Learning Disability Services: A total of £92.6million</li>
	<li>Field Officer Service, providing help across the city: A total of £312,000</li>
	<li>Homelessness and rough sleeping services: A total of £10.6million for these services, including £250,000 for an all year round night shelter for rough sleepers and £250,000 to expand options to support people in emergency and temporary accommodation</li>
	<li>Cityclean refuse and recycling: A total of £27.7million, with more than £1 million allocated for specific support within the service in the year ahead&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Cllr Dan Yates, leader of the council, said: “This is a difficult time for local government in the face of ongoing cuts from central government. Since 2010 more than £100 million has been removed from the core government grants for our council.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We knew when we took administration of the council that there were tough times ahead. Over the last four years we’ve taken the difficult decisions required to make sure we have protected services for the most vulnerable in the city. It’s an ongoing challenge to meet increasing demand for services as costs rise and funding falls.</p>

<p>“This is a time to look forwards to the future and continue with the vital work of protecting services for all residents.”</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>

<p>While there is much debate about amendments to the main budget, the proposed permanent budget amendments combined amounted to just 0.2% of the Gross General Fund budget (£1.451m out of a total £761.647m).</p>

<p>On the night, following debate and an adjournment, the amendments were revised. New&nbsp;versions were&nbsp;put forward for councillors to vote on. These revised versions passed with Labour Group and Green Group support. &nbsp;The budget as amended was then put to the vote and passed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Council tax</h2>

<p>In common with many local authorities, the budget includes an increase of council tax of 2.99%, largely in light of the increasing demand for social care and reducing grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means the average Band D Council Tax contribution to the council would rise by £46.38 to £1,595.45 in 2019/20.</p>

<h2>Come along and hear more&nbsp;</h2>

<p>If this sounds like something you are interested in please come along to one of our candidate information sessions where you can find out more about the election process, what councils do and what’s involved in being a councillor:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monday 18 March, 6-8pm, Brighton Town Hall Council Chamber</li>
	<li>Friday 22 March, 10am-12noon, Brighton Town Hall Council Chamber</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hear from the council’s Chief Executive Geoff Raw and the senior management team about the services the council provides and you’ll also have the chance to meet current councillors who can tell you what it’s really like being a councillor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s also your opportunity to ask questions like ‘Do I get paid?’, ‘What support will I get if I’ve never been a councillor before?’ ‘What is the statutory role of a councillor?’, ‘What can I actually change?’, ‘How do local government finances work?’ and ‘Do I have to join a political party to become a councillor? (The answer is no, you can <a href=""https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/be-councillor-booklet-6c2.pdf"">stand as an independent councillor</a>).</p>

<h3>What does your council do?</h3>

<p>As a unitary council Brighton &amp; Hove City Council is responsible for all local government functions within the city including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>planning and licensing</li>
	<li>education and lifelong learning</li>
	<li>health and wellbeing</li>
	<li>children’s and adult social care</li>
	<li>housing and regeneration</li>
	<li>community safety and cohesion</li>
	<li>waste collection and recycling</li>
	<li>roads and street lighting</li>
	<li>arts, sports and culture</li>
	<li>transport</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We estimate that – working in partnership with other councils, charities and public sector agencies and business - we provide roughly 700 different services.</p>

<h3>How does your council work?</h3>

<p>All councils are led by democratically elected councillors who work together to set the council’s vision, direction and budget. <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/council-and-democracy/councillors-and-committees/your-councillors-and-local-politicians-0"">Brighton &amp; Hove is currently divided up into 21 areas called wards</a>, each represented by two or three councillors depending on the number of people living in them.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council currently works within a ‘committee system’, where important decisions are made across six policy committees:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Children, Young People &amp; Skills committee</li>
	<li>Environment, Transport &amp; Sustainability committee</li>
	<li>Housing &amp; New Homes committee</li>
	<li>Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities committee</li>
	<li>Policy, Resources &amp; Growth committee</li>
	<li>Tourism, Development &amp; Culture committee</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who gets to sit on which committee is decided by the proportion of councillors elected from political parties and as independents and then by the political groups and individuals themselves. Reports come to committees for it to decide on either because it’s a statutory requirement or because a decision is needed as part of implementing a new or ongoing policy.</p>

<h3>What will I actually do as a councillor?</h3>

<p>A councillor’s role centres around community leadership and engagement, responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>representing the ward for which they are elected</li>
	<li>decision-making - developing and reviewing council policy</li>
	<li>scrutinising decisions taken by the councillors</li>
	<li>regulatory, quasi-judicial and statutory duties</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Practically, councillors are likely to be involved in a wide variety of duties including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Preparing for and attending meetings</li>
	<li>Speaking on behalf of the community</li>
	<li>Public consultation and campaigning</li>
	<li>Policy formulation</li>
	<li>Liaising with council staff</li>
	<li>Dealing with casework</li>
	<li>Meeting individual residents</li>
	<li>Representing the council at other meetings</li>
	<li>Attending party group meetings</li>
	<li>Looking at the services the council provides</li>
	<li>Monitoring the performance of the council</li>
	<li>Composing speeches</li>
	<li>Writing articles</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillors have to balance the needs and interests of residents, the political party they represent (if any) and the council. Being an effective councillor requires both commitment and hard work.</p>

<p>A Brexit Resilience &amp; Planning Group made up of staff from across the council has been in place over the past 18 months. The group has been:</p>

<ul>
	<li>monitoring Brexit negotiations</li>

39506,"<p>An all committee review has been taking place looking at the remit and workload of each of the various council committees with aim of making sure decision making is effective and streamlined.</p>

<p>The review has found there are some areas of overlap where work and responsibilities were being duplicated. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Consequently a proposal is being put forward not only to reallocate some work to existing, more relevant committees, but to create a new committee by merging the Neighbourhoods, Inclusion, Communities &amp; Equalities (NICE) and Tourism, Development &amp; Culture (TDC) committees. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All the work currently being undertaken will continue and none of the focus will be lost. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Merging NICE and TDC will save the council approximately £10,000 in councillor allowances and other costs incurred by committees.</p>

<h2>Tourism, Equalities, Communities &amp; Culture</h2>

<p>The proposed name for the new committee is Tourism, Equalities, Communities &amp; Culture Committee&nbsp;(TECC).</p>

<p>The proposal will be considered by the council’s Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee next month and then a meeting of Full Council.</p>

<p>Speaking about the new committee, council leader Councillor Nancy Platts said that co-opted members of the NICE committee - which includes representatives from the voluntary sector, the police and the CCG - would have seats on the new committee to ensure their voices were heard by the council and the city.&nbsp;She said:</p>

<p>“We’re very clear that the views of our partners are intrinsic to the decisions we make as councillors on behalf of the city and we want to hear more of our partners and our communities’ voices at committee meetings.</p>

<p>“Increasing equality is a central principle informing how we plan, finance, deliver, commission and review our services; our commitment to equality and inclusion is unwavering.&nbsp;We will ensure equalities and inclusion continue to be a key factor in all our decisions.”</p>

<h2>Additional&nbsp;proposed changes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Homelessness issues will be within the remit of the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee</li>
	<li>Major building projects will be the within the remit of the Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee</li>
	<li>Economic growth and regeneration will be the within the remit of the Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee</li>
	<li>Councillor ward budgets will be the within the remit of the Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee<br />

40411,"<p>Look out for a form checking who is registered to vote at your address.</p>

<p>A Household Enquiry Form is being delivered to every home in the city this week. It asks you to confirm the details we have about you, or tell us about changes we need to make. It should only take a minute or two of your time to respond.</p>

<h2>Update or confirm the details for your household&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The quickest, easiest and most cost effective way to respond is online.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to <a href=""https://www.householdresponse.com/Home/Welcome"">www.householdresponse.com/bhcc</a>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enter your postcode&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Give the security codes that are printed on the form</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do I need to tell you who is registered to vote?</h2>

<p>Every year, we send a household enquiry form to every residential address in Brighton &amp; Hove. Your information will be used to put together the electoral register. This is the only complete list of people of voting age and is the basis for UK democracy. It is used to call people for jury service, for credit referencing and proof of a person’s identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are legally required to ensure the electoral register is as accurate as possible.</p>

<h2>What happens if I don’t respond?</h2>

<p>You can either post your form back or respond online. If we don’t get a response by 9 August then we will send out a further reminder or a canvasser may visit your property.</p>

40416,"<p>Councillor Nick Childs has announced he will step down in September from his roles as deputy leader of the council and chair of&nbsp;the children, young people and skills committee. He will continue in his duties as a ward councillor for Queen's Park.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Childs explained: “I have decided to resign from my roles due to work and family responsibilities. I have a full-time job which is proving incompatible with the time commitment necessary at the highest level of local government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’m going to dedicate my time to working for the residents of Queen's Park who elected me in May, to make sure their local issues are addressed and I represent our ward fully in the city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“I’ll spend the summer concentrating on handover to colleagues to ensure that the important policies already in hand can be continued into the next academic year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The administration will continue working towards extending premature baby leave for school staff, a workload charter for teachers, the extension of our ‘Every Child a Reader’ scheme&nbsp;and our campaign against the privatisation of Moulsecoomb Primary School.”</p>

<p>The roles will be filled as soon as possible. The role of deputy leader will be formally appointed at a meeting of the full council in the autumn and the role of CYPS chair will be decided before the next committee meeting.</p>

<p>Cllr Childs serves in Queen's Park ward along with Cllr Amanda Evans (Labour) and Cllr Claire Rainey (Green).</p>

40431,"<p>Unpaid council tax is set to be recovered in a new scheme being trialled in Brighton &amp; Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council is one of 29 local authorities chosen to pilot a scheme working with HM Revenue &amp; Customs to use debt information sharing powers to tackle non-payers of council tax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This joint working pilot enables us to identify and focus on the highest earners in the city who are avoiding paying tax. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Rising costs</h2>

<p>Using the new information available, we’ll be starting to send letters out this week to those we know are high earners but not paying their council tax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If people don’t start paying their arrears, they face having their debt deducted directly from their earnings through their employer.</p>

<p>Councillor Dan Yates, lead member for finance, said: “We can’t let those who can afford to pay, not pay. As a council, we’re experiencing the ongoing impact of austerity measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The annual rise in council tax doesn’t cover the rising costs of services or match the demand. We’ll be looking closely at how this scheme works and the potential benefits for all residents.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Millions unpaid</h2>

<p>Last April, council tax bills for the year 2018/2019 were sent to 130,000 bills resident households, totalling more than £162m in council tax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The collection rate in the city was 96.47% per cent, which sounds high but actually means more than £5.7m was unpaid. Locally, we’re just below the national average collection rate of 97%.</p>

<p>We’ll continue a fair approach to recovering unpaid taxes, as set in our new <a href=""http://phantom.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000912/M00008109/$$ADocPackPublic.pdf"">corporate debt policy, approved at the Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee in January</a>.</p>

<p>We also offer support and guidance to residents who need help and signpost any vulnerable residents to the support organisations who can help them manage their money.</p>

41126,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council supports the right to protest at the planned climate change event in the city on Friday 20 September.</p>

<p>The event organisers are liaising with Sussex Police to ensure its smooth-running and to facilitate peaceful protest and are also being supported by the GMB union to ensure the safety of people participating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council’s education team is developing guidance for schools on how they might support their pupils to take part in the event. &nbsp;The council’s advice is that schools should not release secondary age pupils to attend the event unless their parents/carers confirm that they are happy for their children to attend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of primary age children, parents/carers would be expected to accompany their children at the event.</p>

<p>Ultimately decisions about whether school children attend the climate change event are a matter for individual headteachers, not the council.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillors met on Thursday 12 September to consider a report on the preparations that have been made for the climate change event.</p>

<p>Council staff wishing to take part would be expected to take the time off as annual leave or flexi-time in the normal way, subject to operational requirements.</p>

<p>The council has also committed to supporting the United Nations e-learning Climate Change course, with a view to getting at least one teacher in every state school in the city trained up.</p>

<p>Council leader Nancy Platts said: “Climate change is a global crisis. In Brighton &amp; Hove we recently declared a climate emergency and a commitment to go carbon neutral by 2030.</p>

<p>“We’re encouraging everyone who wants to protest about this crucial issue to have their voices heard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’d like to thank the GMB for their work behind the scenes to help make this happen.</p>

<p>“We’re also keen to support the UN climate change teaching initiative. It’s a fantastic opportunity for our schools, and I hope all of them will find a way of releasing at least one member of staff for the 15 hours of training that it requires.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teenage climate change activists, Uma Krieger (14) and Annapurna Marley (18), spoke eloquently about the issues involved and the global situation as well as the city they live in.</p>

<p>Uma said: “We’re grateful for the invitation to speak at today’s meeting. We hope the councillors will continue to support our efforts in this global climate crisis.”</p>

41336,"<p>In the print edition of today’s The Argus newspaper, the front page story featured a photo of council leader, Councillor Nancy Platts, with the quote “We can’t cope” above her picture. Councillor Platts did not say “We can’t cope”, this was made up by The Argus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/17930630.brighton-council-leader-struggle-empty-bins/"">online story</a> does not include the false quote. The article reports on comments made by Councillor Platts at a Labour Party Conference event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Argus contacted Councillor Platts for further comment on the financial pressures facing local government and was given a full reply (shared at the end of this story) two days ago on Wednesday 25 September.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Platts was highlighting how reducing government grants have impacted on delivering services. The challenges and struggles faced by local government have been widely reported, locally and nationally. This is very different from “We can’t cope”.</p>

<p>The Argus was contacted this morning and we asked for a correction and apology to be issued.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Argus apology</h2>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>At about 3pm this afternoon,&nbsp;The Argus&nbsp;agreed to add a correction and apology to their social media posts about the story.&nbsp;A prominent printed correction is due to&nbsp;be published in tomorrow's newspaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Argus statement reads:<br />
<strong>Correction to our front page story Friday 27 September</strong><br />
Councillor Nancy Platts did not say “We can’t cope” as we prominently stated on our front page. The quote was written by The Argus and used to promote an article on page 5 about the ongoing challenges facing local government.<br />
We apologise for misquoting the leader of the council in this way and accept it should not have happened.</p>

<h2>Financial pressures</h2>

<p>In response to a query from The Argus asking for her views on the local government funding situation, Councillor Platts said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Year on year&nbsp;we’ve seen government grants slashed and the impact of this financial attack on local government is being felt by local people.</p>

<p>“It costs more than £2million to run our 700 council services every day. Since 2010 more than £100 million has been removed from the core annual government grants for our council. This means we can find we are struggling to do the basics well such as emptying bins and removing graffiti.</p>

<p>“With more funding we could look at important issues such as making closer links between health and social care services, reinstating rehabilitation, day centres and children’s centres, focusing on more community engagement, building more homes, addressing climate change and improving the look and feel of our city.</p>

<p>“Although the government does give grants for individual projects which we can use to make the city better, funding is ring-fenced so we can only decide how to spend the money within that project and in line with any conditions associated with accepting the grant.</p>

<p>“Until the government starts to release detail of its planned funding for future years we are still very much working in the dark to plan for the safe and effective delivery of important council services for all residents.”</p>

<p>“Last year’s crowd funding campaign expressed the public’s desire to restore the Madeira Terrace to their former glory and we will continue to work hard to achieve this.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">At the start of January 2019, we will be opening an office and community hub in a shipping container on Madeira Drive. This space will help raise awareness of the restoration project and offer a base to raise funds during events.</p>

<h2 style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">Exploring all available fundraising options</h2>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">We will continue to seek heritage funding and other types of funding. We are also considering submitting another bid for HLF funding in March 2019.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The conservation deficit for restoring 60 arches is estimated at £4.8 million. A conservation deficit occurs when the existing value of a heritage asset plus the cost of bringing it back into use is greater than the value of the asset after development has been completed.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">The HLF is the largest funder of heritage assets in the UK and so it is important we focus our efforts on gaining their support to protect and restore the terrace at the earliest opportunity. Their support would provide a strong basis on which to secure the structure and to drive restoration more rapidly. &nbsp;</p>

33311,"<p>Work is now well underway to re-build the Shelter Hall on Brighton &amp; Hove’s seafront.</p>

<p>After two years of work to demolish the original building, strengthen the historic Kings Road arches, support the upper promenade and prevent the seafront road from collapse, the new Shelter Hall is emerging from behind the hoardings.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""380"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/joo9S6wJn24?rel=0"" width=""380""></iframe></p>

<h2>A new venue for our world famous seafront</h2>

<p>The Hall is larger than the previous building, with two internal floors, a rotunda on top and a roof terrace. The building will also incorporate new public toilets.</p>

<p>The multi million pound project is part of the council’s Seafront Investment Programme and is being funded from government grants including a £9 million investment award from the Department for Transport’s Highways Maintenance Challenge Fund, borrowing and council money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Shelter Hall will provide a fantastic new restaurant and venue for the city, with its mezzanine floor, terrace and stunning seafront views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rotunda and roof terrace on the upper prom will house a new café.&nbsp;</p>

33596,"<p>Crest Nicholson has told Brighton &amp; Hove City Council that in the absence of an agreed Brexit deal by Government, it cannot proceed to sign the development agreement for the King Alfred project within the current proposed timeframe.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reaffirming its commitment to enter into the development agreement and to deliver the project, Crest Nicholson said it could only fully do this once a Brexit deal has been confirmed by Government and a known exit strategy is in place.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Speaking after the meeting of the council’s Policy, Resources and Growth Committee, Thursday, 24 January, where Crest Nicholson’s concerns about Brexit were discussed, Leader of the Council Dan Yates said that the council was left with no other choice but to give Crest Nicholson a final deadline. He said:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Whilst we recognise and have sympathy with the uncertainty that Brexit brings and how challenging this is for developers who are making investment decisions, we have to see progress on the delivery of a new leisure centre complex. The council - and the people of Brighton &amp; Hove - must have serious and absolute commitment to this scheme.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The council’s Policy, Resources and Growth Committee unanimously voted to give Crest Nicholson a final deadline of 30 March to enter a development agreement but to still work towards completing the agreement by the end of January. If the original deadline is not met then the council will begin to explore other options alongside working with Crest to conclude an agreement by the end of March.</p>

33751,"<p>On 6 February the planning committee was ‘minded to grant’ permission to build 71 bed and study spaces in a four storey building on land at 41 and 42 Park Wall Farm cottages. The site is close to university campuses on the south side of the A27.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p><br />
There are currently two unoccupied semi-detached flint cottages on the site. They are now in a dilapidated state and have been empty and unmaintained for some years. A request was made to Historic England in January last year to add the buildings to the ‘List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest’ but they were not recommended for listing.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Transport links are exceptionally good for the location, with the train station adjacent, the nearest bus stop two minutes’ walk away and university campuses within walking distance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This is a good use of space and will add to the stock of purpose-built student accommodation close to where it is needed. This in turn helps to relieve pressure on houses in the city that could be occupied by families being turned into HMOs (houses in multiple occupation).”</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Planners worked with applicant Teckton Student Living on a revised scheme (the original proposed a larger building with 90 bedrooms) and the developer will contribute more than £85,000 towards open space. The plans will also include retention of two existing mature trees, a Wych elm and sycamore, as well as hedgerows.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The roof of the new building will be able to take mounted solar technologies and the site will have storage for 56 cycles.&nbsp;<br />

33756,"<p>An appeal against a planning enforcement notice for converting a small HMO without permission has been dismissed by the government’s planning inspector.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The enforcement notice was issued on 15 March last year for 249 Queens Park Road in Brighton. The owner had changed its use from a small house in multiple occupation (HMO) to a large HMO.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Retrospective planning permission for the eight-bedroomed HMO was refused. An appeal against the refusal was also dismissed in February 2018. At the time the planning inspector said the development provided unacceptable living conditions, particularly in the basement where there was a lack of natural light.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A planning enforcement notice was issued in March 2018 and this was the subject of the most recent appeal.</p>

<p><strong>Planning policy and HMOs</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This was clearly not acceptable. Our planning policies help achieve a balance between HMOs and other types of accommodation and support decent living conditions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Queens Park Road is an area where there is already a high concentration of HMOs which can have a negative impact on the environment. The inspector commented that we had good reason to refuse planning permission.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Planning inspector Graham Self noted, ‘there is a legitimate public interest in trying to maintain a reasonably good standard of residential environment in dwellings in Brighton.’&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The owner has five months to convert the property back to a smaller HMO (maximum six bedrooms).<br />

34286,"<p>We’re inviting residents, businesses, community organisations and landowners to give their views on future development of the Conway Street Industrial Area in Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-policy/conway-street-masterplan"">Take part in the consultation</a></p>

<p>Following this initial consultation, which runs until <strong>7 April</strong>, your comments will feed into a ‘masterplan’ for the site which will help guide future development. Conway Street, near Hove Station, is one of the areas identified in our City Plan for new housing and employment space.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The masterplan will help deliver new homes and jobs in central Hove. &nbsp;The project was awarded a £70,000 One Public Estate grant from central government so that partners can work together with the community to make sure that the future use of the site will benefit the city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We will be working with the Hove Station Neighbourhood Forum, developers, businesses and the community on the masterplan.</p>

<h2>Conway Street Industrial Area</h2>

<p>The Conway Street industrial area is made up of a mixture of buildings and roads close to Hove Station, with the railway line to the north, Ellen Street to the south and Ethel Street to the east.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Existing commercial properties include offices, warehouses, distribution centres, some research and development companies and various industrial buildings mostly&nbsp;dating from the 1960s.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The main depot and administrative offices for Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company is in the area, as is the car park for Hove Station.</p>

<p>It also includes land at 1-3 Ellen Street, proposed for residential and commercial mixed-use development by Matsim Properties Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hove Gardens scheme is an £80 million development of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>186 flats</li>
	<li>1,317 square metres of office space</li>
	<li>228 square metres of retail</li>
</ul>

<p>The development proposal was granted planning permission on appeal by the Planning Inspector in January 2019 and will be taken into consideration as part of the wider masterplan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is a masterplan?</h2>

<p>The masterplan will be a <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spd"">Supplementary Planning Document</a> that will provide a more detailed level of guidance to existing City Plan policies. It will help guide developers, planning officers and councillors on the best development uses for the site.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This first stage invites views on the issues and options which will look at the size of the area to be covered and level of detail that should be put into the guidance. You can read the Issues &amp; Options Paper online, along with further information on community consultation events and <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-policy/conway-street-masterplan"">how to get involved</a>, or visit one of our council offices.</p>

<h2>Hove Station Neighbourhood Forum</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.hovestationforum.co.uk/"">The Hove Station Neighbourhood Forum</a> will also be consulting on its draft Neighbourhood Plan and hosting community events, including one where we will discuss the Issues &amp; Options paper.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We will be working with the Forum to ensure the masterplan complements the neighbourhood plan.</p>

<h2>What happens after the consultation ends?</h2>

<p>We will appoint a master planning team in the spring. Consultation on the draft masterplan will follow in the autumn.</p>

35766,"<p class=""bhcc-alert bhcc-alert-info"">Read our <a href=""/node/38751"">updated statement about the King Alfred development from 14 June 2019</a>.</p>

<p>At Policy, Resources and Growth Committee in January 2019, members unanimously voted to give Crest Nicholson a&nbsp;deadline of 30 March to enter into a development agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crest Nicholson remains keen to enter into a development agreement but have made clear they need confirmation there will be an orderly exit from the EU prior to signing the agreement, or confirmation that the UK will remain as part of the EU.</p>

<p>As the Brexit deadline has now been extended, this has affected Crest’s previously agreed deadline to sign by 30&nbsp;March. Legally, this lapse means that a decision to enter into an agreement would need to be taken again by councillors at a future committee meeting.</p>

<p>We are committed to delivering a new leisure centre and pool complex for the city and are exploring all options on how best to move forward. As agreed by the Policy Resources and Growth Committee in January 2019, this includes considering alternative delivery options.</p>

36136,"<p>We have re-appointed Design South East to continue to provide an independent design review service for local planning officers, developers and project teams.</p>

<p>Called DesignPLACE, the service is a tried and tested method of ensuring good design and improving the quality of new buildings, schemes and public spaces by offering independent, impartial and expert advice and training on major planning applications.</p>

<p>Design review is an integral part of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and is used by local authorities across the UK. It works by bringing together a panel of multi-disciplinary practitioners to advise on new development proposals, typically before planning applications are submitted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our service has already been instrumental in evolving high quality, high density housing solutions, making sure effective design is included in local masterplans and creating the best environments for future communities to live, work and play.</p>

<h1>How design review works</h1>

<p>The DesignPLACE process includes briefing the panel on a new scheme and mapping out the key design issues to be addressed by the planning applicant and the local authority. It also involves:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arranging site visits</li>
	<li>Hosting panel meetings</li>
	<li>Summarising the panel’s advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The local planning authority will take the advice into account when considering planning applications.</p>

<p>Design input on planning matters delivers benefits for both the council’s planning team, and its clients. As Chris Lamb, director of Design South East explains:</p>

<p>“For the council, we help reduce officer time spent on design-related advice, particularly in complex situations where design differences need to be resolved. For planning applicants, the review process saves time and money by getting specialist advice in various areas of expertise, ensuring design issues are resolved early.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Find out <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/planning-applications/designplace-review"">more&nbsp;information about the service</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>New panel members</h1>

<p>From early May Design South East will be recruiting for new panel members to join the Brighton and Hove DesignPLACE Review Panel. For more information about joining, contact Sogand Babol on <a href=""mailto:sogand@designsoutheast.org"">sogand@designsoutheast.org</a> or visit the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.designsoutheast.org/news/"">Design South East&nbsp;website</a>.&nbsp;<br />

37886,"<p>Residents’ concerns about high concentrations of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have led to a proposal to extend planning rules across the city.</p>

<p>In most of Brighton &amp; Hove, property owners wishing to convert a family house into a shared house or HMO for up to six people currently do not have to get planning permission. Larger HMOs of seven or more occupants already need planning permission.</p>

<h2>Current planning controls</h2>

<p>At present five wards have controls through an ‘Article 4 Direction’ which means that in the following areas small HMO conversions do need planning permission:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hanover &amp; Elm Grove<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hollingdean &amp; Stanmer<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moulsecoomb &amp; Bevendean<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Queen’s Park<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;St Peters &amp; North Laine</p>

<h2>What we are proposing</h2>

<p>If agreed, property owners will need to get planning permission to change the use of a family home to a small HMO anywhere in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Gill Williams, lead member for planning policy, said: “HMOs are in demand as they provide affordable accommodation for people living and working in a city where rents are high. However, those living in areas with high concentrations of HMOs are concerned about the extra pressures they place on neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>“This proposal aims to make the rules consistent for everyone. It will give residents a say through the planning process to address the balance of HMOs in all areas of Brighton &amp; Hove. It would also bring the planning regulations in line with HMO licensing which is already in force citywide and helps to ensure HMOs are a decent standard.”</p>

<h2>Take part in the consultation</h2>

<p><a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/planning/hmoarticle4direction/"">Give us your views on the proposal</a> from 3 June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The consultation runs from Monday 3 June to Monday 15 July.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In June 2018, the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee decided that the council should explore extending the boundary of the Article 4 Direction to cover the whole city (apart from that in the South Downs National Park which comes under a different planning authority).</p>

<p>During the autumn, the council gathered evidence of where HMOs are, discovering that although most are within the wards covered by the existing Article 4 Direction, there are significant numbers outside these areas all over the city.</p>

<p>Areas with high concentrations where planning permission currently does not apply include the area bordered by the London Road railway viaduct, New England Road and Beaconsfield Road, East Brighton and the Regency ward areas.</p>

<p>In January 2019, councillors agreed to start the process of extending the Article 4 Direction area to cover the whole city. This process includes a public consultation. Any representations made must be taken into account when considering whether to confirm the direction which also has to be considered by the Secretary of State. If confirmed, the direction will come into force on 3 June 2020.</p>

<h1>What is an HMO?</h1>

<p>A House in Multiple Occupation, commonly known as an HMO, is a property occupied by at least three people who are not from one ‘household’ (e.g. a family) but share facilities such as a bathroom and kitchen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Examples include bedsits, shared houses, lodgings, accommodation for employees and refuges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 5,000 licensed HMOs in Brighton &amp; Hove [Source: City Plan Part 2] but many HMOs do not house students – the cost and shortage of housing in the city means that many young professionals and people on low incomes also live in HMOs.</p>

<p>Average property prices in the city are 48% higher than the rest of England and Wales [source: Brighton &amp; Hove <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/general-housing/housing-market-reports"">Housing Market Report </a>(Q4&nbsp;2018)]. The average rent for a one bedroom flat is more than £900&nbsp;a month, whereas renting a room in a shared property is nearly half that at around £500&nbsp;a month.</p>

<p>The team will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>create design options for the first restored arches</li>
	<li>explore potential uses for them</li>
	<li>cost the work involved</li>
</ul>

<p>A requirement of the contract will be to explore the use of innovative renewable technology such as solar panels and rainwater harvesting, as a priority, in a bid to reduce costs in the long-term and help the city to meet its commitment to achieving a carbon neutral status by 2030.</p>

<p>The condition of the Grade II Listed Madeira Terrace is one of the most challenging heritage issues currently facing the city council. On-going maintenance of the structure is no longer possible due to the level of its deterioration. Some sections of the structure have been closed to the public since 2012.</p>

<p><img alt=""Madeira Terrace proposals"" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""166"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/news-madeira-terrace-concept.jpg"" width=""700"" /></p>

<p>In 2016, the cost of restoring the whole of Madeira Terrace was estimated at more than £23 million. As the council does not have funds available to meet this cost, the plan has always been to restore the arches in stages.</p>

<p>The council’s <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2017/save-madeira-terrace-crowdfunding-faqs"">successful crowdfunding campaign</a> raised over £460,000 in 2017 when the aim was to restore three arches to use as a showcase.&nbsp;Recent exploration of restoring just three arches and a petition presented by the Save Madeira Terrace Raffle Group has resulted in a re-think of how the crowd funded arches are delivered.&nbsp;Restoring more arches at the same time would provide much better value for money over the long-term.</p>

<p>The council had already set aside £2 million&nbsp;for the Madeira Terrace restoration project and will now allocate £550,000 of that funding for the first phase of work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>An asset for the community and local economy&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins said: “Restoring Madeira Terrace is complex but we are committed to bringing this iconic structure back to life.</p>

<p>“It is a big part of our shop window and has so much potential as a draw for visitors, an asset for the community and the local economy.</p>

<p>“The structure is important to so many people in the city and this is a positive and eagerly awaited step forward for the project.”</p>

<p>Community campaigner Jax Atkins has raised over £26,000&nbsp;through her local raffles. She added: “We’re hoping this will mean we can see some action. It feels like it’s been a long time coming but as long as progress is being made we are fully behind it.</p>

<p>“We want to see the terrace restored with all our hearts. It is an absolute asset for the whole city and with the right backing and management can once again be the centre piece of our beautiful eastern beachfront”.</p>

<p><a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/planning/design-guide-for-extensions-and-alterations-spd/"">Take part in the consultation</a></p>

<h1>Proposed changes</h1>

<p>Proposed changes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A more positive and flexible approach to new extensions</li>
	<li>Greater clarity on how to protect amenity</li>
	<li>More&nbsp;clarity on how to avoid adverse effects on the host building and street scene</li>
	<li>Clearer guidance and advice for applications within conservation areas</li>
	<li>More&nbsp;information about sustainable building and improving biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<p>The closing date for the consultation is <strong>Friday 16 August.</strong></p>

<p>Councillor Gill Williams, lead member for planning policy, said: “Well designed alterations and extensions can transform properties and improve the quality of life for people living in them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“By providing clearer guidance and advice, we hope to streamline the planning process for homeowners and encourage more attractive, sympathetic and sustainable projects across the city.”</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Our supplementary planning guidance (SPD) on extensions and alterations aims to support the many different improvements people want to make to their properties.</p>

<p>It sets out the things to consider to achieve high-quality extensions and alterations.</p>

<p>This is important in a densely populated place like Brighton &amp; Hove – property owners have to take into account how their plans affect their own properties, the impact on neighbours and how they fit into the street scene.</p>

<p>Councillors discussed the updated draft guidance at the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee on 20 June.</p>

<h1><strong>How the guidance&nbsp;will be used</strong></h1>

<p>We’ll use the comments from the consultation to shape the updated guidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our planning service, developers and landowners will then use the updated guide to make sure extensions and alterations fit the needs and aspirations of everyone involved with good design.</p>

<p>The updated guidance will replace the existing supplementary planning document (SPD12) and become a material consideration in planning decisions.</p>

<p>Although the SPD will not make new or change existing planning policies, the council will use it to help achieve those policies – for example in building new high quality and accessible homes with usable outside space and to complement ‘place-making’ policies that aim to create attractive and successful public spaces.</p>

40206,"<p>A disused dairy will be transformed into a new mixed-used development following approval by the city’s planning committee.</p>

<p>The former Dairy Crest depot in The Droveway, Hove, will be redeveloped to provide offices, retail space and 14 homes, four of which will be at low cost for local people.</p>

<p>All of the proposed housing is for family homes. Half of the houses will be three-bedroom, with affordable housing of one and two-bedroom houses.</p>

<h1>Historic features</h1>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This development shows how you can keep historic features in a modern development. It’s great to see that this site will be brought back into long-term use and create homes and jobs for the residents of today. Even though the housing part of the development is small, there will still be four low cost homes included in the scheme.”</p>

<p>Since they were built in the 19th century the single-storey barn-style buildings with their flint walls have become a popular local feature. The most significant heritage elements of the site will be kept, with some of the original buildings restored and converted to provide the new spaces, while the 20th century additions will be demolished with new buildings that are more in keeping.</p>

<h1>More information</h1>

<p>In addition the scheme will provide nearly £60,000 for open space and recreation facilities in the local area, including £1,700 for improvements to Weald allotments and a further £52,000 for education.</p>

40211,"<p>Hundreds of low cost homes will be built for local people following the granting of planning permission for 242 homes on land to the east of Coldean Lane.</p>

<p>The proposal was put forward by <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> - a partnership between the council and the Hyde Group to build 1,000 new low cost homes for the city.</p>

<p>Half of the units will be available at a discounted market rent affordable for people earning the national living wage and half for shared ownership for residents on lower incomes to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be a mix of units from one bedroom up to three&nbsp;in six and seven&nbsp;storey buildings to make the best use of the sloping 3.3 hectare site. There will also be some wheelchair accessible homes on the ground floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, chair of Brighton &amp; Hove’s planning committee, said: “This imaginative scheme will make an important contribution to helping us meet urgent local housing needs for those least able to afford a home. It will provide a mix of housing for residents on low incomes in the city.</p>

<p>“The proposal also seeks to provide more trees and chalk grassland than is currently on the site, offer long-term wildlife management and incorporate large areas of natural habitat within the development.”</p>

<p>The area is outside the built up boundary of the city and makes up one of a small number of ‘urban fringe’ sites identified in our local City Plan as having the potential for housing development. As the site is undeveloped green space the council’s policy is to make sure these sites maintain and improve natural habitats as well as providing good quality, affordable housing for local people.</p>

<p>An ancient woodland will remain untouched by the development and 0.94 hectares of woodland will receive ongoing management as part of the plans which will improve the health of the trees and help conserve the woodland. Fewer trees will be felled than originally planned and they will be replaced with a greater number of new trees.</p>

<p>To improve chalk grassland, 1.6 hectares will be planted with native species – more than will be lost from the development (0.97 hectares).</p>

<p>In addition a landscape and ecological management plan provides for the long-term management of habitats, species and other biodiversity features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposal also offers half a million pounds for parks and gardens, play and indoor sports facilities and more than £200,000 for secondary and sixth form education provision to be spent in the local area.</p>

40326,"<p>City residents and businesses are being asked to <a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/planning/cil-post-examination-mods/"">give their views on final changes being proposed to the council’s Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) Draft Charging Schedule</a>.</p>

<p>Once in place, the levy will be a new charge on development that could contribute up to £2 million a year towards much needed citywide infrastructure.People will have eight weeks to feedback on the changes being proposed to charges to be brought in under a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which allows local councils to raise funds from new building developments in their area.</p>

<h2>Extra cash</h2>

<p>Under the scheme, developers will have to pay a financial contribution to the council when they want to build new homes, shops or student accommodation, depending on the size of the development. &nbsp;</p>

<p>CIL payments can then be spent on supporting infrastructure in need of extra cash including schools, roads, parks, flood defences, health and other community infrastructure.</p>

<p>The latest consultation follows an independent examination of the draft CIL Charging Schedule which took place earlier this year, chaired by an independent Examination Inspector. The charges set out in the charging schedule range from £50 per square metre for shopping unit developments, to £175 per square metre for purpose built student accommodation and new housing coming forward in central Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>Future development at some larger strategic sites such as at Brighton Marina and the King Alfred Leisure Centre will not incur a CIL charge due to their high development costs and their need to provide significant infrastructure. The changes proposed also include two other sites for a zero charge; the Brighton General Hospital site and the Sackville Trading Estate in Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Latest stage</h2>

<p>Councillor Gill Williams, lead member for planning policy, said: “We welcome this latest stage in the process of putting CIL in place and we currently anticipate that CIL will commence next year. CIL will help to fund much needed infrastructure across the city.”</p>

<p>Local authorities have previously relied on Section 106 planning agreements from larger developments to fund local infrastructure. These agreements will be scaled back to provide on-site requirements such as access roads onto the site. CIL will replace off–site payments and will be charged on a wider range of developments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council will be allowed to spend the money on infrastructure projects anywhere it’s needed in the city.</p>

<p>The council has based the proposed charging rates on an independent study that found new-build residential development, purpose-built student housing and new retail floor space could all bear a CIL charge within a recommended charging range.&nbsp;</p>

40446,"<p>We’ve been asked a number of questions recently about plans to introduce the new generation of mobile phone technology, known as 5G, across the city.</p>

<p>The questions have mainly been around whether the technology is safe or not, and whether the council plans to try to block or delay the introduction of this technology.</p>

<p>So here’s a summary of the council’s current position on 5G technology.</p>

<h3>Economic importance</h3>

<p>The council has a vital role to play in encouraging economic development in the city, and digital connectivity is a key part of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s particularly important as our local economy has such a strong specialism in the creative, digital and IT sectors.</p>

<p>We’re keen to promote the most up-to-date and effective mobile and wireless technology for work premises in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our residents also expect this in their homes and on their phones.</p>

<p>Public Health England (PHE) takes the lead nationally and provides expert advice on public health matters associated with mobile phone technology.</p>

<p>We have liaised with PHE to get the latest information and guidance and to seek their advice on whether there are any health risks for the public.</p>

<h3>Within guidelines</h3>

<p>PHE have told us that the current exposure of the general public to radio waves is well within the international health-related guideline levels that are used in the UK.</p>

<p>They said that when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area the overall exposure to radio waves is expected to remain low relative to these guidelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such there should be no consequences for public health.</p>

<p>UK network operators implementing 5G are committed to complying with the current guidelines.</p>

<p>The ability of councils to influence the roll-out of mobile technology is limited by central government regulations.</p>

<p>But the planning system does require that any new installations are consistent with the international guidelines PHE adheres to.</p>

<h3>Legal rules</h3>

<p>We’re aware that Glastonbury Town Council has approved a motion that opposes the roll-out of 5G in their area until further information is produced by a local 5G advisory committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Glastonbury Town Council does not actually determine such planning applications – whereas we do. So their position is not the same as ours.</p>

<p>Given the legal rules we have to work within as a planning authority, we are unable to adopt a similar approach to Glastonbury and our decisions would be open to challenge if we took such matters into account.</p>

<p>So we are not proposing to adopt this approach.&nbsp;</p>

40706,"<p>Councillors have approved three houses and a two-storey office building on a vacant plot on Upper Gardner Street.</p>

<p>The site is a narrow area that lies between an existing warehouse and terraced houses and the proposal is to build new houses in the northern part of the site and extend the existing building for office space. There will also be a new two-storey bridge building for office use fronting Upper Gardner Street.</p>

<p>Part of the boundary wall that supported the roof over the warehouse has partially collapsed and most of the roof has had to be removed.</p>

<p>For this reason it would be expensive to reinstate the building as a warehouse - currently used for temporary storage of building materials - and would have more value and benefit as good quality smaller office space for which there is a shortage in central Brighton.</p>

<h2>Homes and jobs</h2>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This is a good use of a small vacant site in the heart of the city and will provide homes as well as much-needed work space and an increase of 12 full-time jobs.</p>

<p>“It is an amended scheme which has allowed for a much better proposal to be put forward. The new homes will have plots that are slightly larger than those nearby and create more outdoor space for those who will be living there.”</p>

<p>The wall to the east part of site will also be made good.</p>

40811,"<p>Developer Crest Nicholson has reluctantly taken the decision to withdraw from the King Alfred development in Hove.</p>

<p>The council has been working with Crest Nicholson Regeneration since 2016 when it won the bid to redevelop the 1.8 hectare King Alfred site. Plans include replacing the ageing King Alfred Leisure Centre with improved, extended and modern sports facilities and building much needed new housing, including affordable new homes.</p>

<p>Chris Tinker, Interim CEO of Crest Nicholson said: “It is with disappointment that Crest Nicholson has taken the difficult decision to withdraw from the King Alfred development in Hove.</p>

<p>“Crest has worked with the council, The Starr Trust and other stakeholders for over three years with a view to creating a high quality viable and deliverable scheme but has reluctantly come to the conclusion that the ambition of the scheme in these uncertain times is too great and that the project is simply unable to deliver the required social and physical outputs given the related costs and values.</p>

<p>“The scheme has presented a series of challenges over the promotion period and whilst we would pay tribute to the council and its advisers in working collaboratively with our own team to overcome such obstacles, it has become a more complicated project than originally envisaged in terms of both planning and delivery.</p>

<p>“It is now increasingly apparent that the growing cost of delivering the scheme, including the council’s new £50m leisure centre, at a time when uncertainty has been increasing and values falling, means that the project is no longer able to support the provision of any affordable housing and remain viable.</p>

<p>“This position, despite significant funding pledges from both the council and Homes England, is unlikely to change and the Board has therefore reluctantly decided that it is not willing to promote and deliver a development of this scale and nature.</p>

<p>“All stakeholders have been made aware and we will continue to work with all partners to ensure a smooth transition.”</p>

<p>A total of £23 million of public money - £15 million from the Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF) and £8 million from the council - was approved to assist the developer and facilitate the building of a new sports centre and 565 homes on the seafront site.</p>

<h2>Finding a viable alternative is our priority</h2>

<p>Council leader Nancy Platts said: “I’d like to thank everyone who has tried so hard for so long to make this project a success.</p>

<p>“Of course we are hugely disappointed that Crest Nicholson has confirmed it won’t be progressing the redevelopment of the King Alfred site.</p>

<p>“We’ve worked closely with their team to find a financially viable scheme to deliver a new public sports and leisure facility and provide affordable housing.</p>

<p>“We appreciate the difficulties and complexities of the project, and appreciate too the efforts made by Crest Nicholson, but the council makes no apologies for pressing the developer to deliver the scheme it selected in 2016.</p>

<p>“Finding a viable alternative will be our upmost priority and this will include consulting with the local community who have been so patiently awaiting this development.</p>

<p>“Our objective has always been to provide a new sports and leisure centre as well as much needed affordable housing for Hove. We will continue to explore all ways possible to get the most we can from the site so it is of maximum benefit to local people”</p>

<p>The council has already begun exploring alternative delivery options, as agreed by councillors earlier in the year, and an update on the next steps for the King Alfred project will be presented to the Policy and Resources Committee in the autumn.</p>

40876,"<p>Work has started to improve the appearance of city centre streets by tackling unauthorised signs and changes to shop fronts.</p>

<p>The initiative, led by our planning team, is taking place in Western Road and Church Road where we’ll be working with businesses to improve the appearance of properties and the general street scene.</p>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, lead member for planning, said: “Poor signage and shop front conversions affect the way the whole street feels. If the area is attractive it feels safer and more people will visit, so it is important, both for businesses and residents who live in the area.</p>

<p>“Western Road and Church Road are two of the city’s most popular thoroughfares and part of the city’s historic street scene. There have been an increase in unauthorised signs and shop front alterations in recent years so we’re pleased to be able to work alongside property owners to improve the area.”</p>

<p>Although the team will be mostly concentrating on unauthorised signs and changes to shop fronts they will also be aiming to tackle properties that have fallen into disrepair and encouraging owners to clean them up and make repairs.</p>

<h1>Advice and guidance</h1>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove’s planning service has created guides on shop fronts and advertising signs to help businesses and developers make sure their properties fit in with and enhance the street for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>Western Road is in the Brunswick Town Conservation Area and has many historic features and shop fronts, including The Paris House (number 21), Lane and Stedman (100), Mitre House (144-145), Imperial arcade (203-211) and some imposing former department stores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Church Road is also in the Cliftonville Conservation Area with many attractive buildings.</p>

<p>Our planning team will advise businesses on how they can improve their properties so they meet the city’s local guidance and policy. The council has powers to prosecute for the display of unauthorised advertisements and will consider using these powers where owners are unwilling to make the necessary changes or improvements.&nbsp;</p>

41046,"<p>More than 100 homes for working people on low income will be built in the second major new development put forward by the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove partnership</a> following approval by the planning committee.</p>

<p>Half of the 104 apartments in the £19 million development will be available at Living Wage rents and half for shared ownership.</p>

<p>The homes will be in two blocks of between four and seven storeys with more than 269 solar panels on the roofs and a landscaped courtyard in the middle.</p>

<p>Most of the units will be either one or two-bedroom, matching the demand for this kind of housing in the city – 84% of households on the council’s housing waiting list are looking for one or two bedroom properties.</p>

<h2>The proposal</h2>

<p>There will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>11 studios – providing much-needed starter homes for local people</li>
	<li>50 one-bedroom homes</li>
	<li>39&nbsp;two-bedroom homes</li>
	<li>four three-bedroom homes</li>
</ul>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, chair of the city’s planning committee, said: “This will provide much-needed quality homes for low income households. In the current climate it’s going to make a significant contribution to providing affordable housing that is in extremely short supply in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The proposal makes good use of an existing brownfield site where buildings have outlived their former use. With public transport links on the doorstep and solar panels for energy use, this is a good quality sustainable development.”</p>

<h2>Landscaping</h2>

<p>The development is next to the busy A259 (Wellington Road) and will have a green landscaped strip between the buildings and the road. Trees along the front will wrap around the site and continue into the courtyard.</p>

<p>A steel arch, a nod to the area’s former industrial heritage, will be a striking addition at the entrance of the main public space and native plants will provide biodiversity on the site. A further private landscaped area with trees will be planted by the western block.</p>

<h2>Other benefits</h2>

<p>Sports and recreation facilities, education, transport and local jobs will benefit from the planning contributions for the scheme, as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>£97,650.00 for sustainable transport, including a car club, bicycle parking and 12-month season tickets for use on local buses</li>
	<li>£70,291 toward the cost of secondary and sixth form education at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy</li>
	<li>£54,696 for outdoor sports and green spaces such as children’s play equipment, improvements to parks, gardens, allotments and beach access</li>
	<li>£38,710 for indoor sports on &nbsp;Western Lawns, King Alfred and/or Portslade Sports Centre</li>
	<li>£29,800 for the council’s Local Employment Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>Planning officers worked closely with the partnership to address concerns about the size of the development and air quality because of its proximity to the road. As a result one of the blocks was reduced in height and the buildings set further back to enable the green planted ‘buffer.’ &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Our top tips for preparing festive food</h2>

<h3>Put raw and ready-to-eat food in separate shopping bags</h3>

<p>Take enough bags so you can separate your Christmas food shop. This helps avoid the risk of raw food contaminating other items.</p>

<h3>Make sure your turkey is completely defrosted&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If you buy a frozen turkey, check the packaging to see how long it needs to defrost – it could take as long as four days.</p>

<h3>Don’t wash raw turkey</h3>

<p>It just splashes germs onto your hands, clothes, utensils and worktops.</p>

<h3>Make sure the meat is completely cooked</h3>

<p>Work out the cooking time for your turkey by checking instructions on the packaging. Check the meat is steaming hot throughout, there is no pink meat visible when you cut into the thickest part, and the meat juices run clear.</p>

<h3>Using up leftovers</h3>

<p>Whether you cooked your turkey from fresh or frozen, leftovers can be used to make a new meal, like turkey curry. This new meal can be frozen, but make sure you only reheat it once.</p>

33321,"<p>Seafront Officers are urging residents and visitors to stay safe and keep away from the sea this winter.</p>

<p>The warning comes as the Christmas holiday season approaches and the mild winter weather draws more people onto the beaches.</p>

<p>“Everyone enjoys a bracing stroll on the promenade over the festive season but we would urge people to stay on the path or high up on the beach, especially when the sea conditions are rough,” said Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Seafront Manager Chris Ingall.</p>

<h2>Hidden dangers</h2>

<p>Chris explained how the beach at Brighton &amp; Hove differs from other south coast beaches and has hidden dangers.</p>

<p>“Unlike many other beaches, where you can gradually enter the water, Brighton &amp; Hove beach has a steep shingle slope making it difficult to leave and enter the water especially during the four hours over the high tide period,” he said.</p>

<p>“The combination of winds coming in from multiple directions and steep shingle banks increases the risk of being swept out to sea.”</p>

<p>Parents are urged to keep a close eye on children, holding their hands when on the beach and stopping them from playing ‘chicken’ with the surf washing up the beach.</p>

<p>Dog owners are also being advised to keep their pets on leads and away from the shoreline in rough sea conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>No Christmas Day swim</h2>

<p>The council will once again be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing access to the beaches around Brighton Pier.</p>

<p>“As open water swimming has become more popular over the last few years, we are seeing more groups of swimmers gathering for winter swim sessions,” said Chris.</p>

<p>“It is extremely important that those wishing to enjoy this invigorating and extreme form of free and healthy activity, fully understand the real dangers involved.</p>

<p>“Cold water sea swimming takes skill, stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced, using suitable wetsuits, in very calm conditions and with friends. Even on a calm day sea currents, unpredictable waves or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning. Even experienced swimmers can get caught out.</p>

<p>“Check the conditions on the day and consider all those in the group, the sea will be there tomorrow, don’t take unnecessary risks, that could threaten your life or others trying to help!”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chris added that the seafront team is always happy to advise swimmers on sea conditions. “We have constant updates on the weather conditions and would urge anyone wondering whether it’s safe to swim to ask us first.”</p>

<p>The seafront office 2019 tide timetables for the Brighton &amp; Hove beaches should be available shortly. Information within the booklet also includes a map showing lifeguard stations and a list of seafront events.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Starting the conversation</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Choose your moment</li>
	<li>Recognise young people's knowledge and understanding</li>
	<li>Keep it real</li>
	<li>It's not what you say, it's how you say it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're feeling tongue-tied,&nbsp;try&nbsp;a few&nbsp;conversation starters:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘I need you to help me understand what’s going on as I’m worried.’</li>
	<li>‘Can you try and tell me what’s going on?’</li>
	<li>‘Would you know what to do if you or your friend has taken something and seems unwell?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Facts on smoking, drinking and drugs</h2>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove has some of the highest rates of cannabis use, smoking and alcohol consumption among young people in the country. According to the What about YOUth survey from 2015:</p>

<ul>
	<li>15% of 15 year olds in Brighton &amp; Hove currently smoke, which is the highest rate in England.</li>
	<li>Almost a quarter (24%) have tried smoking cannabis and 14% have smoked cannabis within the last month - the highest rates in the country.</li>
	<li>11% of 15 year olds drink at least once a week, the joint third highest rate in England.</li>
	<li>Engaging in harmful behaviours can have knock-on consequences now and in later life, with some young people at risk of developing severe and enduring substance misuse problems that continue into adulthood.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find out more and get support locally</h2>

<p>Developed alongside <a href=""https://www.ymcadlg.org/support-advice/right-here/"">YMCA Right Here</a>, we've put together advice, support and information for parents and carers to use to help start the conversation and to help challenge widespread misinformation and myths.</p>

<p>Keep Calm and Talk came from listening to the views, experiences and needs of parents and carer’s and their young people. It aims to encourage thoughtful conversations, increase knowledge and understanding and to support changes in behaviours.</p>

34931,"<p>More than 10,000 people have quit smoking in the last four years in Brighton &amp; Hove, and over half of these quitters have stopped by using local support services.</p>

<p>We’re sharing some of their stories this week to celebrate their achievement and to help inspire others to access stop smoking support to help them quit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mark national No Smoking Day on Wednesday 13 March there will be a display in the windows of Jubilee Library from Monday 11 to Sunday 17 March. It includes portraits and quit stories from individuals who have previously accessed stop smoking services in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<h1>How will you give up?</h1>

<p>Our own Healthy Lifestyles team offer a stop smoking service to help you stop smoking and start living with the free support that’s right for you.</p>

35676,"<p>Anyone who is sexually active can get a sexually transmitted infection (STI) – practising safe sex reduces the risk.</p>

<h2>In 80% of cases there are no symptoms</h2>

<p>The most common STIs in Brighton &amp; Hove are: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, genital warts, genital herpes and syphilis. Not everyone who picks up one of these will show symptoms.</p>

<p>Testing for STIs isn’t scary or embarrassing. It’s free, quick, easy and confidential. In most cases, a simple swab or urine sample that you do yourself is all that's needed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are sexually active, you should get an STI test at least once every 12 months, and more often if you're having sex with multiple partners. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you think you have been exposed to an STI, you should get tested, even if you don’t have any signs or symptoms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Even if you test positive, most STIs are easily treated</h3>

<p>Early diagnosis and treatment is important to lower the risk of developing painful complications including infertility. Left untreated, STIs can have serious health consequences.&nbsp;Getting treated quickly is crucial.</p>

<h2>STI Testing Week&nbsp;</h2>

<p>1 to 7 April is Brighton &amp; Hove STI Testing Week. Organised by the Terrence Higgins Trust, and supported by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Public Health team, the annual week aims to encourage local residents to get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Why is STI Testing Week important?</h3>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove has one of the highest rates of STIs in the country. The rate of diagnoses for new STIs in the city is double the rate for England. Young People, men who have sex with men and some BME groups have the highest levels of STIs in the city.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bhconnected.org.uk/sites/bhconnected/files/Sexual%20health%20-%20all%20ages%20B%26H%20JSNA%20topic%20summary%202018.pdf"">Find out more about sexual health statistics in Brighton &amp; Hove</a>.</p>

<p>By highlighting how easy it is to get tested and where you can go, more people will get tested and treated. In 2018, 800 tests were carried out during Brighton &amp; Hove STI Testing Week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alan Boyd, Health Promotion Practitioner at Terrence Higgins Trust in Brighton, said:&nbsp;<br />
“We have very high STI rates in the area including the highest in the South East region and the highest outside of London.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Overall, around 1 in 10 people we see at Terrence Higgins Trust in Brighton tests positive for an STI without showing any symptoms; and many more receive a positive test result from one of our local sexual health clinics. This is why we want to use this week to raise awareness of the importance of STI testing. Not only is testing easy, painless and free to everyone, it’s available across the city this week in bars and clubs, as well community venues and at Terrence Higgins Trust’s Ship Street office.</p>

<p>“STIs don’t discriminate, anyone who is having sex can get an STI. Many STIs have no symptoms, so there is a chance that you or your partner could be infected without knowing it.</p>

<p>“If you are diagnosed with an STI it’s important to get treated and test again to make sure that it’s worked. It’s also vital to let your sexual partner or partners know if you have an STI so that they can be treated and we can reduce the spread of STIs.”</p>

<h2>Get tested&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>Terrence Higgins Trust are offering free testing during the week</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ship Street Clinic – Monday, Wednesday and Friday,&nbsp;10am–5pm&nbsp;and Thursday, 10am–8pm</li>

40231,"<p>The Lawn Tennis Association’s (LTA) programme for primary school aged children is focussed on fun, getting children active, and helping them make new friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Courses take place in the city and across the region all year round and the LTA is hoping to sign up its 100,000th Tennis for Kids participant by the end of 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tennis taster on the seafront</h2>

<p>Former British tennis star Julie Hobbs and a team of local LTA coaches joined city councillor, Alan&nbsp;Robins and children from two local primary schools recently for a first ever tennis session under the city’s iconic British Airways i360.</p>

<p>Hobbs, who coaches at nearby Pavilion and Avenue Tennis Club said: “I’ve played on Centre Court at Wimbledon and some of the most famous tennis venues in the world but nowhere quite as unique as this! To see these children get their first experience of tennis in such an incredible setting was great and hopefully they will want to try it again”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alan Robins, Chair of the council’s Tourism, Development and Culture Committee, added: “Schemes like this are a great addition to the range of activities on offer in the city. We want to encourage more children to lead healthy and active lives and trying out different sports is an important part of this”.&nbsp;</p>

41011,"<p>A proposal to change the kind of care delivered at Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Knoll House adult social care centre in Hove will be considered at a meeting of the city’s Health and Wellbeing Board on Tuesday 10 September.</p>

<p>Knoll House is expected to become available soon for new council services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The changing needs of the city’s residents mean there is now a focus on&nbsp;prioritising&nbsp;mental health services. The plan is for Knoll House to deliver either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>lower level supported accommodation for younger adults with mental health needs to help them live more independently; or</li>
	<li>accommodation for young people with higher levels of mental health needs but who do not require hospital treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knoll House, along with the council’s base at Craven Vale in Brighton, currently delivers therapy and rehabilitation services for older people coming out of hospital with lower level needs. The nursing care at both centres was until recently provided by the local NHS.</p>

<h2>Local and national changes</h2>

<p>But health and social care needs locally and across the country are changing, with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>more and more people leaving hospital with high levels of complex needs and needing nursing care 24-7</li>
	<li>a big increase in the number of younger adults with mental health needs who need residential care.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knoll House and Craven Vale are not best placed to deliver these higher levels of care. So earlier this year the NHS told the council it was going to stop delivering nursing care at the centres, and deliver their rehabilitation services in other ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NHS have assured us there will be no reduction in the capacity or quality of their rehabilitation services.</p>

<p>However, as a result both Craven Vale and Knoll House are not able to admit as many people and are currently operating well below capacity.</p>

<h2>Consulting on merger</h2>

<p>Consultation is underway&nbsp;with staff on plans to merge the two services and consolidate them into a single centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council has said clearly that it intends to avoid compulsory redundancies as part of this process.</p>

<p>This would offer respite care and support hospital discharge for people with less complex needs who no longer need hospital care but who are not yet well enough to move home.</p>

<p>Craven Vale is the preferred site for this because it is much nearer to the Royal Sussex County Hospital. It is hoped that the merger and move to Craven Vale will be completed by the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The Health and Wellbeing Board is being asked to give the go-ahead for full business cases to be worked up for the two proposed options for Knoll House. These would be brought back to the Board in January for a decision on a preferred way forward.</p>

<h2>New ideas</h2>

<p>The board’s chair, Councillor Clare Moonan said: “We are very proud of the excellent care that has been delivered at Knoll House and Craven Vale over many years.</p>

<p>“But we can’t afford to stand still – we have to adapt our services to the changing needs of our population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We will engage with partners and local residents as we develop these new ideas for Knoll House into more detailed proposals.</p>

<p>“The council is committed to working with our NHS colleagues to make sure all our residents can get the health care and support they need now and in the future.”</p>

23841,"<p>The first new homes developed by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council for over 20 years will be unveiled today (11 September).</p>

<p>Balchin Court has been developed on the site of an outdated sheltered housing scheme in Wellington Road, Brighton, through close consultation on issues such as design with tenant representatives.</p>

<p>The development comprises 15 brand new affordable homes, made up of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>three four-bedroom family houses with gardens</li>
	<li>two fully wheelchair accessible flats with&nbsp;gardens – one is two bed and the other is one bed</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also five one-bedroom flats and five two-bedroom flats.</p>

<p>All the homes are owned and managed by the council, which contributed land and money for the project. In addition through the Approved Development Programme Funding for the project came from the Homes &amp; Community Agency.</p>

<p>Housing demand massively outstrips supply in the city, with 17,000 applicants on the housing register, and there is a shortage of family sized homes. Currently hundreds of families are waiting for four-bed homes.</p>

<p>Cllr Bill Randall, Chair of the Housing Committee, said:</p>

<p>“Demand massively outstrips supply for housing in Brighton &amp; Hove so these new homes and the more than 400 in the pipeline represent a massive boost to the city.</p>

<p>“Balchin Court is the first development of new council homes for decades in the city that we have delivered through close work with our tenants.</p>

<p>“Not only are these top quality homes that meet tough environmental and security standards with some fully wheelchair accessible but where possible we have used local labour and apprenticeships.</p>

<p>“Nearly 200 new housing association homes have been completed since April 2011 and another 400 new homes are on site. Many, including those in Pankhurst Avenue and in the new Open Market, are nearing completion.</p>

<p>“Another 100 homes are in the pipeline. In addition, sites for another 300 homes have been identified on council estates across the city. We have bid for government funding to build 45 extra-care flats on one of these, and we are working on plans for another 30 council homes on other small sites.”</p>

33021,"<p>Proposals to build 57 new council homes could get the go ahead at the Housing &amp; New Homes committee next week.</p>

<p>If approved, work will proceed on plans to build 45 homes on the site of the former housing office and adjacent bowls club in Victoria Road, Portslade, and 12 more on a site of under-used garages in Buckley Close, Hove.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""imageRight"" data-delta=""1"" data-fid=""1002211"" data-media-element=""1"" src=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/Victoria-Road-sketch-web.jpg"" typeof=""Image"" /></p>

<p>The schemes are the latest developments in the council’s New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme building new rented council homes. So far, we’ve built 173 new homes on empty or under-used council-owned sites across the city, with many more in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The preferred option for Victoria Road (sketch shown right) would provide a mix of one, two and three bedroom flats, alongside two four bedroom maisonettes and four three bedroom houses. Including the car park, bowls club house and bowling greens within the development increases the number of homes in the scheme from 15 to 45, and facilitates building a new bowling green in Victoria Rec for the Portslade Bowls Club and a new sports pavilion for the use of the bowls club and local football clubs.</p>

<p>The proposals for Buckley Close are for 12 one and two-bedroom flats, including one fully wheelchair accessible flat with a level access shower, adjustable kitchen and storage for electric wheelchairs built in. The designs include 11 off-street parking spaces, and one disabled bay.</p>

<p>The committee will also be looking at an update on the wider raft of work being done to deliver new low cost housing across the city, and plans to expand and speed up this&nbsp;work following the government’s recent announcement on lifting the housing borrowing cap.</p>

<p>In addition to the New Homes for Neighbourhood programme, work includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/node/1969851"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> partnership with Hyde, aiming to build 1,000 new lower cost homes for rent and sale in the city. Proposals for the first sites are underway in Clarendon Place, Portslade, and two urban fringe sites identified for housing in the City Plan in Coldean Lane and north-west of Whitehawk.</li>
	<li>The Hidden Homes project refurbishing and converting under-used and unused spaces in our housing buildings into new homes. Nine new homes have been completed so far, with a further six due to be ready this financial year and around 30 more in the pipeline.</li>
	<li>The<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/node/1970246""> Home Purchase Policy</a>, introduced last year, which allows the council to buy back homes sold under the right to buy. Nine homes have been bought back into the council housing stock to date and the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee recently agreed to extend the scheme to include the option of buying affordable housing units supplied as part of new housing developments in the city.</li>
</ul>

<p>Councillor Anne Meadows, chair of the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee, said: “It’s great to see more new council homes on the way through our New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme. Each site throws up a unique set of challenges and both of these schemes make brilliant use of underused space. I’m particularly pleased that we’ve been able to come up with a scheme at Victoria Road which not only provides 45 new council homes, but also allows us to improve sports facilities&nbsp;for the wider community.</p>

<p>“I’m really proud of all the work we are doing to provide much needed new low cost homes in the city. With so many people on the joint housing register, 2,000 households in temporary accommodation and rising homelessness, it is a key priority for us.</p>

<p>“The lifting of the Housing Revenue Account borrowing cap is something we’ve been pushing hard for in Brighton &amp; Hove and we’re keen to make sure it can help us expand and speed up our work to provide new homes.”</p>

33511,"<p>A new online reporting system is being developed to make it easier for people to report problems with poorly managed and maintained private rented housing in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>The move comes after the council successfully bid for £34,820 of government money to pay for the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new system will enable tenants experiencing problems with their home to request help, provide detailed information and upload photographs to highlight concerns.</p>

<p>Council staff can then quickly make a full assessment and target enforcement action to tackle problems, such as disrepair, safety concerns, damp, and excess cold, more effectively and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Improving private rented homes</h3>

<p>Almost a third of homes in Brighton &amp; Hove are privately rented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Tracey Hill, the council’s lead member for Private Rented Sector on the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee, said: “There are a lot of responsible landlords in the city, but we also know that many tenants are living in poor condition properties that are not properly maintained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This new initiative will enable us to build on work we are already carrying out to protect tenants and improve the standard of private accommodation in the city.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new online reporting form is due to be introduced in April.</p>

<p>Funding is from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s Rogue Landlord Enforcement Grant Fund.</p>

33526,"<p>Residents’ concerns about high concentrations of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have led to a proposal to extend the current planning rules across the city.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In most of Brighton &amp; Hove, property owners wishing to convert a family house into a shared house or HMO for up to six people do not have to get planning permission. Larger HMOs of seven or more occupants already need planning permission.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Six years ago we&nbsp;introduced controls in five wards through an ‘Article 4 Direction’ which means that in those areas small HMO conversions need planning permission.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In June 2018, the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=969&amp;MId=9190"">Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee</a> decided that we&nbsp;should look to see if there is evidence for extending the boundary of the Article 4 Direction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During the autumn, we&nbsp;gathered information of where HMOs are, discovering that although most are within the wards covered by the existing Article 4 Direction, there are also some significant numbers outside these areas in other parts of the city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Areas with high concentrations where the need to obtain planning permission does not currently apply include parts of Preston Park, East Brighton and Regency ward areas.</p>

<h2>What is proposed</h2>

<p>The proposal aims to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make the rules consistent for everyone</li>
	<li>provide long-term certainty for developers and residents</li>
	<li>prevent concentrations getting too high before action is taken</li>
</ul>

<p>It would also bring the planning regulations in line with HMO licensing which is already in force citywide.</p>

<p>At their meeting on 17&nbsp;January&nbsp;councillors decided to go ahead and open up the proposal to public consultation. Any representations made must be taken into account when considering whether to confirm the direction. The Secretary of State has to be informed of our&nbsp;decision and may cancel the Direction if it is not justified by evidence.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Julie Cattell, lead member for planning, said: “The cost of housing in the city and overall shortage of new housing means that many young professionals and people on low incomes live in HMOs and they are in high demand, but high concentrations of HMOs can put extra pressure on communities and residents are concerned.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“This proposal is not intended to stop HMO development but give the public more say in managing change of use applications through the planning process to ensure a more even spread in neighbourhoods.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />

	<li>A night shelter for all people who are rough sleeping opens in extreme weather</li>
	<li>A new phone number is available directly to the shelter when it is open</li>
	<li>Outreach workers help people who are rough sleeping all year round and let them know when the shelter is open &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>A number to call</h2>

<p>You can now contact the SWEP (severe weather emergency protocol) team directly if you’re worried about someone bedding down on the streets when the overnight cold weather shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From tonight (Thursday 24 January), the SWEP team can be reached on 07895 407168 from 7pm on the nights when the shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SWEP shelter opens during extreme cold weather for anyone who is rough sleeping. The shelter provides an evening meal, a place to stay and bedding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Outreach workers go out and about during the day before SWEP opens to let people know the shelter will be available that night. Details of<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/homelessness-and-rough-sleepers/how-we-help-rough-sleepers-city""> when SWEP is open are also posted on our 'how we help rough sleepers' webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Central location</h2>

<p>SWEP’s main base is at Wagner Hall on West Street from 7pm to 8am (when day services open).</p>

<p>Sometimes people choose not to go into the shelter at 7pm and can be out on the streets much later in the evening. People on the street are made aware shelter is available but no one has to take up the offer.</p>

<h2>New contact number</h2>

<p>The SWEP team can be reached on&nbsp;07598 346109&nbsp;from 7pm on the nights when the shelter is open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can speak with one of the SWEP team to ask questions about the shelter and be given reassurance places are available if people are in doubt about whether they can go in. You can also share a location and description of someone you’re concerned about. Outreach workers will be able to check if help has already been offered. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you reach the voicemail please leave information about who needs helping. You might not receive a reply if the service is very busy but the phone with be checked regularly for messages. Please note, this is not an emergency line and if you’re concerned for someone’s safety or health call the emergency services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Clare Moonan said: “We’ve set up the telephone link to make sure concerns can be raised as quickly as possible. We also encourage people to call the Streetlink service with information which will also be passed on to outreach workers at times when SWEP is not open. We to make sure as many people as possible can come in from the cold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“SWEP is part of a range of rough sleeping services, including a winter night shelter for up to 30 people running until March and a hub where up to 17 people have their needs assessed to help them move away from the streets. We’re working together with our partners to make a real difference for those in need.”</p>

<h2>Open more this winter</h2>

<p>The trigger for opening the SWEP shelter is when a 'feels like 0 degrees'&nbsp;temperature is forecast by the Met Office and also takes into account windchill. The trigger for opening SWEP in Brighton &amp; Hove is one of the lowest in the country.</p>

<p>At this point last year the shelter had opened only 12 times during the same period. So far this winter, SWEP has been open for 20 nights. The first time the shelter opened this winter was on 12 December 2018. The difference is because the trigger for opening was previously higher so the shelter met the criteria for opening less frequently. The current “feels like 0 degrees” trigger was introduced following consultation with residents this summer.&nbsp;</p>

	<li>New report reveals national rough sleeping situation</li>
	<li>Brighton &amp; Hove figures included</li>
	<li>Help is available locally for those in need but services are stretched</li>
</ul>

<h2>Government figures</h2>

<p>The national announcement of rough sleeping figures from across the country shows there is still a staggering number of vulnerable people in need of help to move away from the streets.</p>

<p>In the report released today (Thursday 31 January) by the Ministry of Housing Community and Local Government (MHCLG), Brighton &amp; Hove remains in the 10&nbsp;areas experiencing the highest numbers of people rough sleeping.</p>

<p>New services and shelters have improved the situation locally in the last twelve months but the number of people continuing to flow onto the street remains high.</p>

<h2>Annual count</h2>

<p>The MHCLG statistics are based on the annual counts which take place nationally on one night in November. Our local count took place on Wednesday 21 November and <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2018/support-rough-sleepers-making-difference"">details were shared in December</a>.</p>

<p>The city was split into 13 patches. Teams of outreach workers and volunteers worked together to make a record of people bedded down in the city after midnight and through the early hours on the count night.</p>

<p>64 people were found sleeping rough. The count was verified by independent observers from the organisation Homeless Link.</p>

<p>The figure for 2018 cannot be directly compared with the previous year because the method was changed following discussions with the ministry about how other areas conduct their counts. However, when combined with other local data sources, the downward trend becomes clearer.</p>

<h2>Housing crisis</h2>

<p>Cllr Claire Moonan,&nbsp;lead councillor for rough sleeping, said: “We’re experiencing an ongoing national housing crisis and it’s shocking how quickly someone can end up in dire need on the streets.</p>

<p>“Helping people move away from rough sleeping is a priority for this council and, working with our partners, we’re making a positive sustainable&nbsp;difference to people’s lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’ve invested in services and successfully bid to government for funding to run new shelters and expand support for people who are rough sleeping. We’re moving in the right direction but I’m concerned about what the future holds when the current government funding ends in March 2020, little over a year away. The flow of new rough sleepers every week still remains very high.</p>

<p>“While the number of people who are sleeping rough at any time is considerably lower than in previous years, there is still much work to be done. In particular, to address the underlying causes of rough sleeping and homelessness at a national level. As far as I am concerned, even one person rough sleeping is too many. We will do all we can to help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“At the same time, our services are stretched and we urge anyone without accommodation arranged not to come to the city.”</p>

<h2>Regular research</h2>

<p>The council and partners monitor the situation locally to tailor services according to need. Regular street counts are carried out across a wide area of the city covering the vast majority of people rough sleeping. A comprehensive overview is also provided by a database, shared by agencies supporting those in need, which is updated daily with information from across the city.&nbsp;</p>

35126,"<p>Proposals from the Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove partnership to develop more than 200 new affordable homes on a site in the north of Whitehawk are to be stopped.</p>

<p>The decision was taken at a Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove board meeting on Monday 18 March following a report identifying that the development of affordable housing would not be financially viable due to a number of access and technical difficulties on the site.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> is a partnership between Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and the Hyde Group, aiming to build 1,000 new much-needed affordable homes for rent and sale in the city for lower income, local working households.</p>

<p>The Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove board is made up of three councillors from the main parties on the council’s Housing &amp; New Homes Committee and three representatives from Hyde.</p>

<h2>Whitehawk proposals</h2>

<p>The Whitehawk site had been identified for housing development in the Draft City Plan Part Two, following the requirement to look for sites for 1,000 new homes on the city’s urban fringe to help meet the urgent need for housing established in the City Plan Part One.</p>

<p>Feedback from the public consultation and some local opposition expressing concerns about the environmental impact of the proposals were noted by the partners. Landscape and ecology studies have shown that, with certain ecological mitigations in place, housing could be developed on the site without significant adverse impacts on the Local Nature Reserve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plans for the first two Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove proposed developments in Portslade and Coldean are progressing, and further sites are being investigated.</p>

<p>Funds will be used for clothing, toiletries, food, individual support, day centre services and much more. No funds raised will be used for administration of the charities. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working together</h2>

<p>Cllr Clare Moonan, lead councillor for rough sleeping, said: “We’re working closely with our partners to make sure vulnerable people on the streets are offered the help they need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Make Change Count offers residents and visitors to the city a way to make sure their generosity helps people to move away from rough sleeping. The alternative giving campaign provides options and information to help people decide how best to give their money, if they choose to do so. It’s not about telling people what to do.”</p>

<p>Andy Winter, chief executive BHT, said: “Begging is not about rough sleeping. It is about addictions. &nbsp;Begging feeds addictions and provides a disincentive to seeking and accepting help. People give money for the best of motives but at best they are helping to sustain addictions and rough sleeping. &nbsp;At worst it provides the means to acquire the drugs that could kill them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Those giving money can be conned by those begging. &nbsp;A sign that says that someone needs £20 to book into a hostel is a great begging pitch, but it is untrue. No hostel in Brighton charges upfront. &nbsp;But £20 will be enough to feed a drug addiction for a short while.”</p>

37486,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove residents can fix their energy costs and get peace of mind for a year from their local, council-supported energy supplier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your Energy Sussex, set up by local councils in 2018, has launched two new energy tariffs for Sussex residents and is encouraging households that have never switched to take a look.</p>

<p>There is a competitively-priced 12-month tariff and a 24-month tariff that will lock in the amount you pay for your gas and electricity for two winters.</p>

<h2>Your Energy Sussex&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Customers will get a really competitive price, excellent customer service, 100% renewable electricity and the satisfaction of knowing that they are helping the local community.</p>

<p>This is because Your Energy Sussex is run on a not-for-profit basis. Any surplus after costs have been met is being used to build a fuel poverty fund to support local people who are struggling to pay their energy costs.</p>

<p>Councils in Sussex launched Your Energy Sussex to encourage more people in the county to become regular energy switchers.</p>

<p>Figures from Ofgem show that only 25% of households compared their energy costs and switched supplier in the past year - and households could save as much as £300 per year on average by switching.</p>

37781,"<p>Residents have a chance to discuss proposals to build new 'move-on' housing&nbsp;at drop-in sessions in at the Old Boat Corner Community Centre.</p>

<p>The proposal is to develop 13 flats on the site of the former Hollingbury Library for people ready to move from higher support accommodation into self-contained homes.</p>

<p>The drop-in sessions are being held between 3.30pm and 6pm on Monday 3 June and between 6pm and 8.30pm on Thursday 6 June.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Residents who can’t make the sessions can have their say through <a href=""https://consultations.brighton-hove.gov.uk/housing/former-hollingbury-library-site/"">an online survey on our consultation portal</a>. The online survey is open from Friday 31 May until Friday 28 June.</p>

<p>The project will be partly-funded through a £750,000 government grant through Homes England.</p>

<h2>Tackling homelessness in the city</h2>

<p>The proposed new ‘move-on’ homes will be for people who have previously been homeless and are ready to live in their own self-contained flat with support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone moving in would be assessed to make sure they’re ready to take the next step towards independent living.</p>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, chair of the council's Housing &amp; New Homes Committee, said: “During the recent local elections, many residents told us that they were concerned about the levels of homelessness in the city and it is our priority to do all we can to support people back into secure housing.</p>

<p>“Self-contained housing for people moving on from higher need services is a vital part of our efforts to tackle homelessness in the city and frees up space elsewhere.</p>

<p>“This type of accommodation has proved a great success in helping people rebuild their lives elsewhere in the city and we hope residents will understand and support the proposals to provide this new purpose-built housing.”</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>All responses to the consultation will be put together in a report to the Housing &amp; New Homes Committee in September and the decision on whether or not to proceed with the proposals will be made there.</p>

<p>If approved, the scheme will be developed through our <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/council-housing/new-homes-neighbourhoods"">New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme</a> building new rented council housing for the city.</p>

<p>The Homes England funding must be taken by March 2021. If the scheme looks unlikely to go ahead at that point, the grant investment risks being lost to the city.</p>

39116,"<p>The national homeless crisis has led to a rise in the number of people living in tents, locally and across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/17/removal-of-homeless-camps-trebles-as-charities-warn-of-out-of-control-crisis"">Today the Guardian reported on this sad national trend</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Guardian reported that in Brighton &amp; Hove we charge people rough sleeping “£25 for a confiscated tent”. This is not the case and the Guardian was given the full information before publishing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Visitors camping</h3>

<p>The way we deal with tents in the city reflects that there is a range of reasons for people camping illegally. As a tourist destination, people often pitch up on the beach in the summer months&nbsp;rather than paying for official campsites.</p>

<p>We do all they can to prevent people from camping in places which are unsafe for themselves or others using the area.</p>

<h3>No charge for rough sleepers</h3>

<p>The £25 charge is for storage of tents that are removed after notice&nbsp;has been given that they’re pitched where camping is not allowed. The storage fee is designed as a deterrent to stop people camping in the city. Tents are usually removed when they’ve been abandoned. The storage fee is waived for anyone who is homeless or sleeping rough. &nbsp;Only two people have claimed their tents back from storage and neither was charged due to their circumstances.</p>

<p>When we know people are rough sleeping, we aim never to take their tents away. Our outreach workers work to move people away from the streets by providing support about better alternatives. Outreach workers are not in any way involved with enforcement.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Working with partners</h3>

<p>Sometimes we do have to remove tents, particularly after reports of anti-social behaviour including illegal behaviour which has been reported to the police. When this happens, we follow a clear set of guidelines that have been agreed with the police and other agencies.&nbsp;</p>

40256,"<p>Work is due to start on the first development by an innovative partnership building 100% low cost homes in the city.</p>

<p>Approval to build 242 low cost homes in Coldean Lane was agreed at the planning committee on Wednesday 10 July.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The homes are being developed by <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> - a partnership between the council and the Hyde Group aiming to build 1,000 new low cost homes for rent and sale for lower income working households in the city.</p>

<h2>Building new low cost homes&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The new homes will be built on council-owned land to the east of Coldean Lane. The site has been identified as suitable for the development of housing in the City Plan.</p>

<p>The homes will be a mix of one, two and three bedroom flats in six and seven storey buildings, making the best use of the sloping 3.3 hectare site. There will also be a number of wheelchair accessible homes on the ground floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Half of the new homes will be available for rent to people on the council’s joint housing register, with the other half to buy available as shared ownership homes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Listening to residents</h2>

<p>Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove held two rounds of consultation with local residents over the summer of 2018 before finalising the plans.</p>

<p>Following concerns raised about parking, the designs were amended to increase the number of spaces from 120 to 162. That offers parking for 67% of the homes - 17% more than vehicle ownership studies recommend.</p>

<p>A car club space has also been added, along with a Brighton Bike share scheme hub, offering shared transport options that can benefit the wider local community.</p>

<p>Changes were also made to the road junction plans to include a right turn filter lane, and two pedestrian crossing islands and 30mph speed signage were added to improve safety on Coldean Lane.</p>

<p>The height and scale of the blocks and number of homes were reduced to improve the visual impact of the site and allow better views from the South Downs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The amount of green space and play space and the number of footpaths were also increased.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Maintaining the habitat</h2>

<p>The development will provide more trees and chalk grassland than are currently on the site, offer long-term wildlife management and incorporate large areas of natural habitat.</p>

<p>An ancient woodland will remain untouched and 0.94 hectares of woodland will receive ongoing management to improve the health of the trees and help conserve the woodland.</p>

<p>Fewer trees will be felled than originally planned and they will be replaced with a greater number of new trees.</p>

<p>To improve chalk grassland, 1.6 hectares will be planted with native species – more than the 0.97 hectares lost from the development.</p>

<p>In addition a landscape and ecological management plan provides for the long-term management of habitats, species and other biodiversity features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposal also offers half a million pounds for parks and gardens, play and indoor sports facilities and more than £200,000 for secondary and sixth form education provision to be spent in the local area.</p>

<h2>Working together to deliver new homes</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, chair of the council’s Housing &amp; New Homes Committee and chair of Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove, said: “We are in a national housing crisis and the city is urgently in need of low cost homes. We know that many people raised in the city can no longer afford to live here and more people than ever are at risk of homelessness.</p>

<p>“Alongside our commitment to speed up the delivery of new rented council homes, Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove is a key part of our plans to increase the supply of genuinely affordable homes in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is a clear priority for us and it’s very exciting to see the first proposals from the partnership taking such a significant step forward. It will be the largest single development of 100% affordable housing in the city for a generation.</p>

<p>“Joining forces with Hyde allows us to speed up the delivery of new low cost homes and look at sites neither of us would be able to do as effectively alone.</p>

<p>“We’ve listened to residents and understand their concerns about both the challenges the benefits this development will have on the local community.</p>

<p>“The feedback we received helped us improve the scheme in ways that we believe will enhance the existing community and their new neighbours, as well as helping us meet urgent local needs for housing.”</p>

<p>Tom Shaw, Managing Director (Development) at the Hyde Group said: “Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove is an innovative partnership set up with the sole purpose of building genuinely affordable homes for local people in Brighton &amp; Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are delighted to have reached this exciting milestone of securing planning approval for the first homes, and look forward to beginning construction shortly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is no single answer to tackling the housing shortage in Brighton &amp; Hove. However, this project will undoubtedly provide a real boost to affordable housing delivery in the city.”</p>

40421,"<p>In response to recent national newspaper reports, Cllr Nichole Brennan, deputy chair of housing committee, said: “We have a welfare first approach for people rough sleeping in our city and our council outreach teams do not work with Home Office immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>“We’re working with partners across the city to support the many vulnerable people who live out on our streets to overcome their complex problems, and find the best way to rebuild their lives. Our city has long been under pressure from growing homelessness at this time of austerity. St Mungo's has run the council’s rough sleeper outreach homelessness service since 2015 and has provided compassionate care under difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>“We sometimes help people experiencing homelessness in Brighton &amp; Hove return to their home countries, but will only do so with their explicit permission to act this way on their behalf. We will not pass on personal data to the Home Office unless we’re sure informed consent has been given from the individual concerned.</p>

<p>“Rough sleeping is harmful and dangerous. No one should have to sleep rough in this day and age. I will do all I can to help people in need here in Brighton &amp; Hove.”</p>

<h2>Dignity and respect</h2>

<p>Cllr Nicole Brennan, deputy chair of housing committee, explained: “I am very concerned with the plight of the homeless in this country and city as a result of the housing crisis that has been caused by lack of government investment in housing and services.</p>

<p>""Underfunded and overburdened services in health and social care add to the desperate situation many people find themselves in.</p>

<p>“I’m also concerned about rough sleepers who for different reasons do not access or feel comfortable using the services available. They are still human beings who need to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p>""One of my aims is to develop services to meet their needs by listening to what they have to say.”</p>

40881,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove residents can save money on energy bills this winter by switching their supplier.</p>

<p>A new energy tariff from local council-backed supplier <a href=""https://www.yourenergysussex.org.uk/"">Your Energy Sussex</a> offers customers price protection for two winters on gas and electricity.</p>

<p>The deal is available until 31 August.</p>

<p>Your Energy Sussex is a partnership between Sussex councils and Robin Hood Energy, the licensed energy company owned and operated by Nottingham City Council.</p>

<p>It was launched by West Sussex County Council in February 2018 and is supported by 12 local authorities, including East Sussex County Council and Brighton &amp; Hove City Council.</p>

<h2>Comparing suppliers saves money</h2>

<p>Only 25% of households compared their energy costs and switched supplier in the past year.</p>

<p>Many people have never switched suppliers and – if on their energy supplier’s most expensive ‘standard variable’ tariff – could be paying up to £300 more than they need to each year.</p>

<p>Your Energy Sussex say their customers get a competitive price, excellent customer service, 100% renewable electricity and the satisfaction of knowing that they are helping the local community.</p>

<p>This is because Your Energy Sussex is run on a not-for-profit basis. Any surplus after costs have been met is being used to build a fund to support local people who are in fuel poverty.</p>

<p>The renewable electricity supplied to customers is certified as being sourced from UK-based wind and solar generators.</p>

<h2>Helping tackle fuel poverty</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, chair of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Housing Committee, said: “Our latest estimates show that there are more than 15,000 households in the city in fuel poverty.</p>

<p>“By switching to Your Energy Sussex, with competitive energy bills, carbon reduction through 100% renewable energy, and help for local people struggling to pay their energy bills, everyone can win.”</p>

<p>Councillor Siriol Hugh-Jones, the opposition lead for housing sustainability, said: “The council is committed to our city becoming carbon neutral by 2030.</p>

<p>“Housing is crucial to&nbsp;this. A council-backed supplier offering a combination of 100% renewable energy, help for local people in fuel poverty and competitive tariffs is clearly a step in the right direction.”</p>

<p>It includes one two-bedroom house and 11 one-bedroom homes, including a fully wheelchair-accessible flat.</p>

<h2>New Homes for Neighbourhoods</h2>

<p>The homes are the latest development completed in our New Homes for Neighbourhoods programme, building new council homes across the city.</p>

<p>It takes the number of new homes completed up to 185 on 12 empty or underused council-owned sites across the city</p>

<p>Many more homes are in the pipeline, with building work underway on 30 flats on the site of the former housing office in Selsfield Drive, Brighton and 12 new homes in Buckley Close, Hangleton.</p>

<p>Plans are also underway for 42 new homes on the site of the Victoria Road housing office in Portslade, which facilitates a new bowling green in Victoria Rec for the Portslade Bowls Club and a new sports pavilion.</p>

<h2>Delivering more affordable housing</h2>

<p>Councillor Allcock said: “It’s a real pleasure to welcome the first residents into these fantastic new council homes right in the city centre.</p>

<p>“In a year marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which paved the way for the mass programme of council house building across the country, these are new homes we are proud of.</p>

<p>“In 1979, 42% of Britons rented council homes. Today that figure is just under 8%. Many of those were sold under the ‘Right to Buy’ and they too often end up in the hands of private landlords who charge high rents for properties that aren’t always up to standard. Often it is Housing Benefit that covers the cost of those rents, so tenants lose out, the council loses out and the public loses out.</p>

<p>“The answer absolutely has to be that we build hundreds more council houses like these, at rents that mean people don’t struggle to pay. And the government needs – at the very least – to suspend the Right to Buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s a clear priority in the joint plan we’re working on with our Green Party colleagues to do all we can to increase the supply of genuinely affordable housing in the city.”</p>

<p>Councillor Gibson added: “It’s great to welcome new residents and see the difference a secure council home can make to their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These high quality new council homes are the first completed in our joint and ambitious plan to provide 800 additional council homes over the next four years.</p>

<p>“There is a long way to go, but the severity of the affordable housing and homelessness crisis faced by the city demands a bold response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“As the opposition, we’ve pledged to work with Labour on putting the city first and doing politics differently to solve the key issues facing Brighton &amp; Hove. It’s heartening that we are making progress on our shared aim of building more council homes in the city.</p>

<p>“It’s also good to see more brand new council-rented homes that meet high energy and water efficient standards on heating and water bills and reduce carbon, so will be cheap to keep warm.”</p>

41061,"<p>A judge has dismissed an appeal against rooms being too small to rent on the owner of a property in Brighton.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National legislation setting a minimum bedroom size of 6.51 metres square for one person in Licensable Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) became law on 1 October last year.</p>

<p>Licensing conditions to increase the size of two rooms in a property in Hanover were imposed by the council following an inspection earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rooms were found to be below the mandatory size and conditions were added to the licence asking the landlord to enlarge the rooms.</p>

<h2>No discretion over minimum room size</h2>

<p>At an appeal against the conditions bought by the landlord, the tribunal judge said that the court had no discretion to permit the use of rooms below the minimum size.</p>

<p>The tribunal struck out the appeal on the basis that there were no reasonable grounds for it to succeed</p>

<p>The ruling confirms there is no legal discretion to allow use of rooms in licensed properties which fall below the statutory minimum size.</p>

<p>The rooms will now need to be enlarged or re-arranged, or the council will consider revoking the landlord’s HMO licence, resulting in the owner being unable to be let the property as an HMO.</p>

<h2>HMO licensing</h2>

<p>The Hanover property is covered by the city’s ‘Additional HMO Licensing’ scheme.</p>

<p>This is a discretionary scheme local authorities can introduce where certain conditions are met. It covers properties of two or more storeys with three or more tenants sharing facilities and living there as more than one household.</p>

<p>Additional licensing was introduced to a number of areas, including Hanover &amp; Elm Grove, in 2014 to improve property conditions and management standards of private rented housing in those areas.</p>

<p>It was expanded city-wide in March 2018 following the success of the scheme in improving conditions.</p>

<p>All HMOs let to five or more people who form two or more households and share facilities have to be licensed under national mandatory licensing rules.</p>

<p>Minimum room size regulations apply to premises licensable under Part 2 of the Housing Act 2004, as a mandatory condition of the licence. This covers the national mandatory licensing and any local additional licensing schemes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As any existing HMO licences come up for renewal, the minimum size conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h2>Improving standards in private rented accommodation</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, chair of the council's Housing Committee, said:&nbsp;“I’m really pleased that the tribunal has upheld the conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Everyone has the right to a decent standard of housing and this decision confirms that the minimum room size really is the minimum people should be living in.</p>

<p>“Private rented housing makes up more than 31% of the city’s housing and is a vital source of accommodation in Brighton &amp; Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our existing licensing schemes aim to raise standards across the city’s privately rented homes and have already ensured thousands of properties are better managed and safer for residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Without our additional licensing scheme, we wouldn’t be able to apply the room sizes regulations. It helps us ensure tenants in the city can live in safe, well-managed and decently-sized homes.</p>

<p>“We are committed to working alongside our Green Party colleagues on a range of measures to further drive up conditions and standards in private rented accommodation for residents in our city.”</p>

<p>Plans outlined in a report to the committee include delivering 800 additional council homes alongside 700 other new low cost homes over the next four years.</p>

<p>Priorities set out in the work plan for the next four years also include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improving private rented housing</li>
	<li>Alleviating homelessness and rough sleeping</li>
	<li>Achieving carbon reduction and sustainability in housing</li>
</ul>

<p>A report to the committee on the city’s housing supply sets out a range of initiatives being used to tackle the city’s housing shortage. These include:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New Homes for Neighbourhoods&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Nearly 600 new council homes could be built through the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/council-housing/new-homes-neighbourhoods"">New Homes for Neighbourhoods (NHFN) programme</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently 30 homes are under construction in Selsfield Drive, Brighton, 12 in Buckley Close, Hangleton, and plans have been submitted for 42 homes in Victoria Road Portslade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ve built 184 new council homes through NHFN to date, including the <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2019/welcome-new-council-homes-kensington-street"">recently completed homes in Kensington Street</a>.</p>

<p>More projects are in the pipeline, including sites earmarked for development in Frederick Street, Brighton and Rotherfield Crescent, Hollingbury.</p>

<h2>Small sites and ‘Hidden Homes’</h2>

<p>More than 40 new council homes could be provided by converting empty or ‘hidden’ spaces in council properties, and building on small pockets of land.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Swallow Court, Whitehawk, a former office has been transformed into three flats, two extra flats have been provided at Elwyn Jones Court in Patcham and 10 extra homes will be provided on the Bristol Estate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plans have been approved for three homes in Manor Road, Whitehawk and there are more potential sites are in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Home Purchase Policy</h2>

<p>A total of 23 former council homes, sold under the Right to Buy, have been brought back into council ownership through the <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/housing/housing-supply/sell-your-property-back-council"">Home Purchase Policy scheme</a> since it was launched in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council is in the process of purchasing 23 more properties and, subject to budget approval, it is hoped to increase the number purchased to 50 a year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other affordable new homes</h2>

<p>In addition to 800 new council homes, the council is contributing to other affordable housing schemes in the city with the aim of providing 700 low cost homes.</p>

<p>Plans for 242 homes in Coldean Lane – the largest single development of 100% affordable housing in the city for a generation – and 104 in Clarendon Place, Portslade have been approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sites are the first two developments by <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> - an innovative partnership between the council and the Hyde Group building new low cost homes for rent and sale for lower income working households in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tackling the housing crisis</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, the chair of housing, said: “Providing more affordable housing is a clear priority for us and it’s great that we’re able to work with our Green Party colleagues on our common agenda to deliver hundreds of more low cost homes in the city.</p>

<p>“The national housing crisis is particularly difficult in Brighton &amp; Hove, and delivering these council homes will make a big difference to people struggling to afford housing in our city.</p>

<p>“The council has been delivering new homes for a number of years and we’ve built up the capacity and experience to ensure our projects are delivered quickly, effectively and to a high standard.</p>

<p>“In a year marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which paved the way for the mass programme of council house building across the country, it’s exciting to be working on such ambitious plans to build more housing for the future.”</p>

<p>Councillor David Gibson, the opposition lead for housing, added: “The severity of the affordable housing and homelessness crisis faced by the city demands a bold response.</p>

<p>“The pledge to the city made between Greens and Labour outlined our shared priority to tackle the city’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis.</p>

<p>“Labour Councillor John Allcock and myself as Green Housing lead are working closely together to do all we can to increase the supply of genuinely affordable housing in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The important goal of 800 additional council homes will be a step change which aims to more than replace all the council homes lost over the last 12 years under the right to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are focusing our energies into tackling the city’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis – and in doing so, putting the city first.”</p>

41121,"<p>Councillors will be asked to give approval for work to begin on the Homelessness &amp; Rough Sleeping Strategy 2020 to 2025 at&nbsp;<a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=1021&amp;MId=9880&amp;Ver=4"">next week's Housing Committee.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strategy will look at the how best to help some of the most vulnerable people in Brighton &amp; Hove and what more can be done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first stage will be to organise a wide ranging consultation to build on the plans already in place and look to the future.</p>

<p>The proposed strategy brings together two existing lines of work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The current Homelessness Strategy 2014 to 2019 was our third Homelessness Strategy. It set out the agreed approach to responding to and preventing homelessness.</p>

<p>The initial Rough Sleeping strategy was developed in 2016 to 2020 in collaboration with partners across the city. Shared objectives, agreed by agencies across the city, help to shape the activities and make a positive difference.</p>

<h2>Welfare first approach</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, the chair of housing, said: “The recent dramatic rise in homelessness across the UK is symbolic of national policy failure and the fraying of the social fabric. It is a sign that, as a society, we are allowing people to fall through the cracks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“A lot has changed in the last few years and we are determined to provide support for those who are unfortunate enough to be homeless, by giving them respect, dignity and help in their struggle to find a home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’ve brought in a lot of new support to help people to move off the streets and lower figures in our latest street counts show this is helping, but we are determined to do more.</p>

<p>“We’ll be looking at how our new strategy can tie all the support together and deliver on our promises. We’re taking a welfare first approach.</p>

<p>“The homeless of Brighton &amp; Hove are our citizens and our neighbours and everyone should have a right to a home.”</p>

<p>Councillor David Gibson, the opposition lead for housing, added: “It’s a scandal that one of the six richest nations in the world cannot tackle rough sleeping. That’s why both Greens and Labour have pledged to work with partners in our city to bring an end to it.</p>

<p>""This includes providing a 365 day night shelter, achieving an extra 1500 affordable homes over the next four years and expanding housing first support for the most vulnerable homeless people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>""Nearly a decade of Conservative Government cuts have taken their toll – and their failed policies have created what they themselves describe as 'a broken housing market.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>""We hope that the combined homeless and rough sleeping strategy will move us closer towards ensuring safe and affordable homes for all.”</p>

<p>The plans follow recognised good practice around reviewing and updating&nbsp;strategies. The review is also in line with a government requirement to review, rewrite and combine the homelessness&nbsp;and rough sleeping strategies by April 2020.</p>

41136,"<p>Councillors are being asked to approve progress on a new joint night shelter and supported accommodation service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A report going to&nbsp;<a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=1021&amp;MId=9880&amp;Ver=4"">next week's Housing Committee</a>&nbsp;proposes procuring a joint service for a 365 day a year night shelter and supported accommodation, budgeted for up to £450,000 per year, for two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If taken forward, the services will add to the range of help available for some of the most vulnerable people in our city.</p>

<h2>Finding a venue</h2>

<p>A major challenge has been finding a suitable venue for the service and work on this is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officers have carried out an extensive property search for a suitable venue, including the council’s property list, private leasing, empty properties, church halls and buildings used by charities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obstacles include buildings needing extensive work to make them safe and existing bookings making the venue unavailable.</p>

<p>Finding the right location is essential to taking the service forward and work is ongoing to resolve this. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Priority to open as early as possible</h2>

<p>Councillor Nikki Brennan, deputy chair of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s Housing Committee and lead for homelessness and rough sleeping, said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have committed funds and put a lot of work into finding a building for a night shelter, opening 365 days a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Expressions of interests went out this summer asking for organisations to let us know if they’d be interested in running it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s my priority to secure a suitable venue and ensure this vital shelter is up and running as early as possible.”</p>

<p>Councillor Amy Heley, the opposition lead for homelessness and rough sleeping, added:</p>

<p>“Greens have continually supported community calls for a year-round night shelter so I’m pleased there has been progress after such a long time trying to find a suitable venue.</p>

<p>“We have pledged to work with Labour to solve the key issues facing our city today, including our housing and homelessness crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This includes our shared priority of providing a year-round night shelter, along with ensuring that we improve the support available for those in emergency and temporary accommodation.”</p>

<h2>Support for rough sleepers</h2>

<p>The latest move is part of the council’s key priority to end the need to rough sleeping in the city.</p>

<p>The council has a range of support in place to reduce the number of people who are rough sleeping, including outreach, advice and accommodation services.</p>

<p>We work with charities and volunteers across the city to ensure services are co-ordinated by all providers.</p>

<p>Every two months outreach workers carry out a street count of the number of rough sleepers in the city.</p>

<p>This information is used, along with data from service providers, to continually assess and improve support available.</p>

41141,"<p>The second new development by an innovative partnership building 100% low cost homes in the city has been given the go ahead.</p>

<p>Approval to build 104 low cost homes on the site of the former Belgrave Day Centre in Portslade was agreed at the planning committee on Wednesday 4 September.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final surveying will begin on site shortly, with building work due to begin next spring.</p>

<p>The homes are being developed by <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/planning/major-developments/homes-brighton-hove"">Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove</a> - a partnership between the council and the Hyde Group aiming to build 1,000 new low cost homes for rent and sale for lower income working households in the city.</p>

<h2>Building new low cost homes&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The new homes will be built on council-owned land in Clarendon Place, Portslade, facing on to Wellington Road. The site is identified as suitable for housing in the City Plan.</p>

<p>The homes will be in two blocks, between four and seven storeys. There will be 11 studio flats, 50 one-bedroom flats, 39 two-bedroom and four three-bedroom.</p>

<p>This matches the size of housing needed in the city. Currently, 84% of households on the council’s housing waiting list are looking for one or two bedroom properties.</p>

<p>Half of the new homes will be available for rent to people on the council’s joint housing register, with the other half to buy available as shared ownership homes. Rents will be set to be affordable to households earning the National Living Wage.</p>

<h2>Listening to residents</h2>

<p>Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove held two rounds of consultation with local residents in July and October last year before finalising the plans.</p>

<p>Following feedback from the local community and other stakeholders, the number of homes was reduced from 122 to 104, with the taller block reduced from eight storeys to seven.</p>

<p>The blocks will also be set further back from Wellington Road. Electric car charging points have been added to all car park spaces, and an extra visitor parking space and delivery bay has been added.</p>

<p>The development will also have two extra car club spaces and a Brighton Bike share hub on site.</p>

<p>The location benefits from good transport links to surrounding areas, and is close to shops and local amenities on Boundary Road.</p>

<h2>Landscaping the area</h2>

<p>The buildings are set back from Wellington Road, and will include a ‘green corridor’ of elm trees, hedges and seasonal plants. Trees along the front will wrap around the site and continue into the courtyard.</p>

<p>The blocks will have more than 269 solar panels on the roofs and a landscaped courtyard in the middle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A steel arch, a nod to the area’s former industrial heritage, will provide a stunning entrance to the main public space and native plants will provide biodiversity on the site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stepped buildings – designed by Conran and Partners – will be built with robust, textured brick and stone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working together to deliver new homes</h2>

<p>Councillor John Allcock, chair of the council’s Housing Committee and chair of Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove, said: “Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove is a key part of our plans to increase the supply of genuinely affordable homes the city urgently needs and it’s great to see this second development move a step closer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Delivering more affordable homes in the city is an agenda we share with our Green Party colleagues and we’re working closely together to make sure that happens.</p>

<p>“With the Coldean site, this brings the total of new low cost homes on the way from the partnership to just below 350. Those homes will make a big difference to people struggling to afford housing in our city.</p>

<p>“We’ve listened to residents and the feedback we received has helped us improve the scheme and we’re sure the development will be a positive addition to the neighbourhood, as well as providing much-needed housing.”</p>

<p>Councillor David Gibson, the opposition lead for housing, added: “It’s great that last week the planning committee approved another batch of much-needed affordable new homes in partnership with Hyde.</p>

<p>“The partnership with Hyde was set up to enable the council to provide the city with more affordable homes on top of the existing council house building programme.</p>

<p>“Greens have pledged to put the city first, and we will work with Labour on solving the housing and homelessness crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Together we have set a target of building 1500 extra affordable homes over the next four years and these additional 104 low cost homes in Portslade will make a concrete difference.”</p>

<p>Guy Slocombe, Group Business Development Director for Hyde said: “Homes for Brighton &amp; Hove is an innovative partnership set up with the sole purpose of building genuinely affordable homes for local people in Brighton &amp; Hove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We know the need for affordable housing is high and so we are delighted to have reached this exciting milestone of securing planning approval for our second scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is no single answer to tackling the housing shortage in Brighton &amp; Hove. However, this project will provide a boost to affordable housing delivery in the city, while also contributing to the regeneration of the harbour area.”</p>

<h2>Make Change Count has three main aims:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Helping people who are rough sleeping to access support services available in the city and to move away from the streets</li>
	<li>Encourage an alternative option to giving directly to individuals on the street&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Asking residents to let <a href=""http://www.streetlink.org.uk/"">Streetlink</a> know where to find anyone in need so tailored help can be offered (more details below)</li>
</ul>

<p>All money donated to the Make Change Count campaign goes to people in need in our city. Contributions are used to provide food, access to shower facilities, healthcare, clothing and a wide range of practical help based on individual needs. Outreach workers and street services guide people to access the right accommodation where they will be further helped on a one to one basis to recover physically and mentally from the trauma of rough sleeping. No funds raised are used for administration of the charities or the campaign. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Will Williams, manager, Equinox, said: “We’re always keen to say that we’re not telling anyone how they should spend their money, that’s a matter of personal choice. We are sharing our experience of working with people in need and highlighting how by donating to our charities you can be sure the funds will be used in a positive way.</p>

<p>“Make Change Count gives people confidence that their giving has the right impact. We know there are a wide range of reasons that people beg, not all associated with a lack of accommodation. We believe that giving money on the street can sustain people in unhealthy situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“By donating online or by text, you’re making a big difference. We make sure the funds go to help people, not just today, but for a better future too. You can help to save and rebuild lives by donating right now.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alison Marino, executive director of Sussex Nightstop, said: “People on the street are in a vulnerable, and often dangerous, situation. &nbsp;We treat people with dignity, providing the opportunity to sleep safely at night whilst they get support for the issues they are facing and work towards securing a safer, more suitable home.”</p>

<p>Frances Duncan, Chief Executive Officer, The Clock Tower Sanctuary, said: “We know that the public are shocked by the number of young people who are homeless in the city and really want to help. By donating to Make Change Count they can be assured that their money will contribute to moving these young people from crisis to stability.”</p>

41306,"<p>Earlier this year, we carried out structural surveys on our eight ‘large panel system’ tower blocks. These surveys were conducted by specialist structural engineers Pick Everard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survey was completed in June and found no structural issues with any of the buildings. The report also stated that the buildings are generally in good structural condition.</p>

<p>Large panel structure systems were popular in the 1950’s and 60’s for building multi-storey residential buildings. The buildings consist of reinforced floor and roof structures supported by precast concrete large panel walls.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Updating our records</h2>

<p>The surveys were carried out to ensure our records on the buildings are up-to-date, following concerns raised about certain types of ‘large panel system’ high-rise blocks nationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of the city’s tower blocks are of the same construction type as any that have raised concern. Throughout our regular maintenance programme, we’d found no indication of any issues with the blocks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reports did highlight some non-urgent repairs and these will be scheduled into our programme of planned maintenance.</p>

<p>We’ve been in touch with residents of the blocks about the survey results and will continue to survey all our buildings regularly.</p>

<p>The library ran a competition for its young readers to send photos in to be included in the mural and you can see the faces of the winners in the frame!</p>

<p>Chris also took the opportunity to entertain children and grown-ups from the nearby St Andrews primary school.</p>

<p>The children’s section of the library was refurbished over the summer as part of the wider improvements to Hove Library,&nbsp;helping&nbsp;us make the most of the historic building.</p>

<h2 class=""subtitle2"">Hove Library developments</h2>

<p>The library service is now working with new partners to make the most of the educational and cultural facilities of Hove Library to reach new audiences and attract new users.</p>

<p>These partnerships also bring in much needed income to help support library services and to ensure the long term sustainability of running library services in the current building.</p>

<p>The first stage in developing the new areas was setting up a new study space for British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) in the building in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have now also converted former offices on the lower ground floor into a nursery run by Hove Village and set up a community café in the main library area. This is run by Café Domenica - a charity whose main focus is working with young adults with learning disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customers can take drinks away to other areas of the library, apart from the Wolseley Room on the upper floor due to the sensitive archival materials in that room.</p>

<p>For those who prefer a quieter space, the upper floor of the library remains a quiet area for study and reading.</p>

<p>The Ranger Volunteers have been carrying out practical conservation projects in parks and nature reserves across Brighton &amp;&nbsp;Hove every Friday since 2011.</p>

<p>In the new year the group will be expanding and working at weekends.</p>

<p>Ranger Neil Doyle explained: “Because of work and other commitments not everyone can make the Friday task, so from January we will also be meeting fortnightly either on a Saturday or a Sunday.”</p>

<p>Volunteers are asked to sign up to the mailing list to receive emails with details of tasks along with maps showing how to get to the meeting point. To join in, just reply to the email and turn up at the meeting point at 10am.</p>

<p>No experience is necessary and tools are provided, along with tea and coffee!</p>

<p>“All we ask is that you are aged 18 or over, and don’t bring your children or pets to the conservation task,” said Neil.</p>

<p>“Some people come most weeks, others just a few times a year,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;“But everyone enjoys spending time in the great outdoors with a group of friendly people, all doing their bit, to do the work that wouldn’t get done without the help of volunteers.”</p>

<p>The first task in the New Year will be on Sunday 6&nbsp;January.</p>

<p class=""default""><a href=""http://consult.brighton-hove.gov.uk/public/bhcc/event_strategy/outdoor_event_strategy_to_2024"">Give your views on the draft Outdoor Events Strategy.</a></p>

<p class=""default"">Brighton &amp; Hove is well-known for the variety and quality of its festivals and events - the city holds around 250 every year. Many of these are free and use public spaces such as the seafront and parks, as well as cultural places such as the Royal Pavilion Garden.</p>

<p class=""default"">The council plays a major part in helping events to happen and has developed a draft Outdoor Events Strategy to 2024. It aims to provide a greater focus on the quality, distinctiveness and impact of events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""default"">We offer a dedicated events service which brings together a wealth of experience from across the council, including cleansing and waste, roads management, technical infrastructure and venues.</p>

<h2 class=""default"">What does the draft strategy propose?</h2>

<p class=""default"">An Outdoor Events Charter – the first in the country – to build better relationships between event organisers, residents and businesses.</p>

<p class=""default"">In signing the charter, the council would simplify the application process and assist the planning of priority events which in turn helps provide financial support for community events.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Organisers would sign up to ensuring that their event makes a positive contribution to the quality of life for local communities and the local economy, including looking after the environment and minimising disruption.</p>

<p class=""default"">The charter includes a commitment to sustainability, such as not using single use plastic and re-using and recycling wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""default"">Other proposals for discussion include:</p>

<ul>
	<li class=""default"">The potential for a winter festival in Brighton &amp; Hove</li>
	<li class=""default"">Finding ways to connect event organisers so they can support one another (particularly useful for smaller events) and build on local expertise&nbsp;</li>
	<li class=""default"">Continue to invest in community activities through income generated by commercial events. Community events are not charged a fee if there are no road closures involved.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""default"">Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the &nbsp;city’s culture, tourism and culture committee, said: “We have a national reputation for staging fantastic events in the city, from Brighton Festival and Fringe, Pride and the Brighton Marathon, to Burning the Clocks, Paddle Round the Pier and the Take Part Festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""default"">“This is a great opportunity to build on that success and ensure we look after the environment and the city’s communities. Please take a moment to comment on the strategy and share your ideas.”</p>

33401,"<p>Councillors are being asked to support a Conservation Plan which aims to improve the Royal Pavilion Garden and get it removed from the Heritage at Risk Register.</p>

<p>Members of the Tourism, Development and Culture Committee are also being asked to approve spending £25,000 to re-submit a Round 1 Heritage Lottery bid in March.</p>

<p>The Grade 11 listed Royal Pavilion Garden was added to the Historic England at Risk Register last year following concerns about high levels of visitor use, erosion of character and a general deterioration in the sense of history. Historic England called for a Conservation Plan to be developed to address issues as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>A plan was drawn up, a consultation launched, attracting more than 1,300 responses, and a bid &nbsp;submitted for £194,000 to develop the plans ready for a funding bid for £3.3 million.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bid was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>However, the Heritage Lottery Fund encouraged the council to re-submit, highlighting work that should be undertaken in the meantime. &nbsp;This includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carrying out an access audit</li>
	<li>Developing designs of what a new boundary and improved entrances might look like</li>
	<li>Providing evidence of how multi agency working will tackle anti-social behaviour</li>
	<li>Providing more details of an activity programme, interpretation strategy and volunteer roles and skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>The estimated cost of this work is £25,000 which would be met from the Royal Pavilion and Museums core budgets.</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">Public art inspired by shipbuilding will create a local wildlife haven in Portslade.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This month local designers Millimetre will begin installing the structure on Wharf Road embankment, a triangular shaped piece of land next to the road at the entrance to Shoreham Port and Hove Lagoon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Inspiration for the project came from a technique known as ‘spline’ which comes from the shipbuilding industry. It is where long thin strips of wood or metal are bent and held in place under stress creating smooth, curving shapes. In shipbuilding it minimises the vessel’s drag in the water.</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"">Designer and Project Manager Adam Harris said: “The brief to environmentally and artistically enhance the space gave us the opportunity to combine a sculptural structure with an ecological underpinning. The piece will evolve as the plants establish and gradually envelope the structure creating a green wall that will help absorb carbon emitted by the stream of passing traffic.”</p>

33531,"<p>Over 3,000 more people visited Hove Library in the months following a refurbishment and the introduction of a new café.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visitor numbers were up to 35,919 in November and December, nearly 10% higher than the equivalent months in 2017.</p>

<p>Café Domenica, run by a local charity who work with young adults with learning disabilities, opened on the ground floor in October, following a major refurbishment of the library in the summer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Investing for the future of Hove Library</h2>

<p>Hove Library is a much loved historic building, but the age and design of the building makes it expensive to run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funding from central government is reducing each year and all council services, including libraries, need to change how they deliver services to save money.</p>

<p>To continue providing a modern library service that the public use and love from Hove Library’s building, we needed to find new ways of generating income to help cover the costs.</p>

<p>In early 2017, we held a public exhibition to gauge support for a number of potential new public and commercial spaces in Hove Library, and the majority of respondents were positive about the proposals.</p>

<h2>A bright new start</h2>

<p>The first stage in developing these new areas was setting up a new study space for British and Irish Modern Music Institute (BIMM) on the first floor in spring 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In summer last year, internal refurbishment and alterations were made to free up the basement to accommodate a nursery and provide space for a community café on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The work also involved installing new ICT equipment and extra shelving to replace that lost elsewhere. The amount of shelving space for books and other stock in the library remains as it was before the refurbishment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finishing touch to the refurbishment was <a href=""https://new.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2018/fantastic-chris-riddell-mural-celebrates-young-readers-hove-library"">the addition of a fantastic mural in the children’s section by illustrator and author Chris Riddell.</a></p>

<p>The total cost to the council of the refurbishment work was £87,958.</p>

<p>Working with BIMM, Café Domenica and Hove Village Day Nursery, brings a rental income of £38,500 per year, which goes towards maintaining a sustainable library service.</p>

<p>Using scientific research from their remains, 3D reconstructions have been recreated to show what they may have looked like.</p>

<p>As the newest archaeology gallery in the UK, the Brighton Museum space has been designed to get away from the traditional glass cases full of pots and flints.</p>

<p>Instead the gallery has been designed to appeal to children who study the time period as part of the National Curriculum. Teachers and education specialists have been involved in the creation of the new gallery along with members of the Sussex Archaeology Society.</p>

<h2>Step back in time</h2>

<p>The gallery uses sound, film and images to illustrate life in Saxon times including the sound of people working, cooking and sawing.</p>

<p>Museum curator Richard Le Saux said: “I’m very proud of the new gallery and we hope visitors will find it fascinating.</p>

<p>“We think it will be very exciting to come face to face with our local ancestors with our 3D reconstructions and see how they helped to shape our lives.”</p>

<h2>Amber Cup</h2>

<p>The museum will also feature some of the most important historical finds from the Sussex area including the internationally important Amber Cup, one of the largest prehistoric amber objects found in the world, the beautiful Romano-British bronze Woodingdean Stag, designated as an item of national significance by the government and the Sarsen Stone, found in Mile Oak believed to be part of a neolithic henge which would have been placed to track the movements of the sun and the moon.</p>

<h2>Story telling</h2>

<p>Children will also be able to enjoy an original adventure story and illustrations produced by local author Imogen White and illustrator Jennifer Khatun. The story follows Elva a young girl which will give young people the chance to imagine life as a Brighton &amp; Hove child in the past.</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the tourism, development and culture committee said: “We are extremely proud to be opening our new, exciting and innovative archaeology gallery.</p>

<p>“By bringing the past to life, with special effects, sights and sounds we hope we can inspire and educate a whole new generation of young people.”</p>

33741,"<p>Glamorous hats from one of the world’s top designers go on show at the Royal Pavilion from February 7.</p>

<p>Stephen Jones Hats at the Royal Pavilion will see the spectacular state rooms filled with exquisite hats created by master milliner Stephen Jones OBE.</p>

<drupal-entity alt=""Stephen Jones OBE"" data-align=""right"" data-embed-button=""file_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""image:image"" data-entity-embed-display-settings=""{&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;image_link&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9a07e5b7-3253-4705-9d75-b59219930ca2"" title=""Stephen Jones OBE""></drupal-entity>

<p>During his 40 year career, Jones has dressed the finest heads from across the globe – most recently the Duchess of Sussex, as well as Lady Gaga, Kate Moss and Mick Jagger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This new, site-specific exhibition will show hats worn by these celebrities, and others along with those made in collaboration with top fashion designers, including Dior, Thom Browne, Giles Deacon, Comme des Garçons, Marc Jacobs and Matty Bovan.</p>

<h3>Chinoiserie-on-Sea</h3>

<p>“I grew up in a seaside town, but Brighton to me seemed exciting, exotic, and it symbolised art and freedom,” said Stephen. “In 2012, I designed a collection called ‘Chinoiserie-on-Sea’ for which I researched Brighton, and in particular the Pavilion, extensively; and it feels like showing my hats there is almost like a homecoming. I have never had the opportunity to display hats in the environment which inspired them.”</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The opulent Banqueting Room hosts a ‘dinner’ for the hats of the most famous wearers including the Duchess of Sussex, Kylie Minogue and Missy Elliott</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Royal and regal hats are on display including a series of crowns and a new felt hat for King George IV, a recreation of a hat worn by the monarch which appears in a portrait from 1783</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Food and feasting inspired hats are placed among&nbsp;the copper pots in the Great Kitchen, from a giant swan headdress to a knitted ‘English breakfast’ hat</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hats from Chinoiserie-on-Sea - Jones’ homage to the grandeur of the Royal Pavilion – including hats inspired by its famous domes and the exquisite Chinese inspired interiors are on display in the entrance hall</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hats inspired by the interiors of the Royal Pavilion made for the China: Through the Looking Glass exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art will be on show in the Music Room along with gowns by the House of Dior</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hats exploring the theme of Pride, and those inspired by music and musicians including Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are gowns by Dior in the Music and Egyptian Rooms, mannequins dressed by Giles Deacon will ascend the staircase wearing oversized headdresses, and a mannequin wearing a Thom Browne ensemble is on display in the King’s bedroom&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exhibition, which has been co-curated by Stephen Jones OBE and Martin Pel, Curator of Costume and Textiles at the Royal Pavilion and Museums runs until June 9. The exhibition is presented in partnership with Harvey Nichols.<br />

34226,"<p>The remains of one of the oldest Manor Houses in the country will be preserved and its story brought to life by a group of Portslade enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Members of Fresh Start Portslade group have been awarded Heritage Lottery Funding (under the Small Grants Scheme), to research and raise the profile of the historic Grade 11 listed Portslade Old Manor House.</p>

<p>The group has been working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, which owns the site, to submit the bid for the project which aims to raise awareness of the importance of the Manor, and celebrate Portslade’s heritage since 1066.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1TiQf5-4gQ"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>Hidden away behind St Nicolas Church, Portslade Old Manor House is one of a very few examples of Norman Manor Houses that still exist in England. The ruins include parts of the original east and south walls as well as part of an early 17th century west wing extension.</p>

<p>Medieval manor houses are extremely rare in this country and Portslade Manor House has been declared a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II listed building.</p>

<h2>Volunteer training</h2>

<p>The Lottery Funding will be used to provide support and training for a team of 15 local people to research the history of the Manor, and its importance to Portslade over the last 900 years.</p>

<p>The research will be displayed on information boards around the Old Manor site, giving a timeline from the 11th century to the present day.</p>

<p>Volunteers will be trained in heritage conservation and grounds maintenance to become guardians of the site, ensuring its upkeep and protection for future generations.</p>

<h2>Bringing history to life</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, a trustee of Fresh Start and chair of the council’s tourism, development and culture committee said:</p>

<p>“We are absolutely delighted that the Heritage Lottery Fund has recognised the importance of preserving Portslade Old Manor House.</p>

<p>“The Manor Ruins are currently hidden behind fencing, with few people having any knowledge of their history. Our project will open up the site, preserve what is left of this important building and bring its fascinating history to life for future generations.”</p>

<p>Work on the project is due to start in April.</p>

<p>The Friends of Hollingdean Park and the council have worked with professional chainsaw artist Daniel Cordell to inspire the creation of this stunning natural play feature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inspired by&nbsp;the fruits and leaves found around the park and the beetles and the Wartbiter Cricket found on chalk downland locally, the bench reflects the biodiversity of the <a href=""https://www.thelivingcoast.org.uk/"">Brighton and Lewes Downs Biosphere</a>.</p>

<p>Bordered by the Downs, Hollingdean Park is near to the children’s centre and Hertford Junior School and a short distance from Hollingbury Hill Fort. The area also includes an orchard and forest garden planted by the Permaculture Trust and Friends of the Park.</p>

<p>The council will be installing more natural play features in city parks, providing a climbing and scrambling feature for younger children as well as a useful seat!.</p>

<p>From the vibrant bulbs and fragrant blossom, to the busy nesting birds, and emerging butterflies, the Victorian burial grounds provide an oasis of calm away from the busy city centre.</p>

<p>Set in 42 acres, the landscaped gardens include lawns and flower beds, a waterfall and stream, rockeries and a wooded valley and are home to a rich variety of wildlife.</p>

36486,"<p>England legends Kelly Smith and Rachel Yankey joined Brighton &amp; Hove Mayor Dee Simson, at the historic Royal Pavilion to welcome the official FIFA Women’s World Cup Trophy Tour to the city.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove was the only venue in England chosen to host the FIFA World Cup Trophy as it travels across the globe visiting all 24 countries that will compete in the final tournament.</p>

<p>Coinciding with St George’s Day, the stunning Royal Pavilion provided the perfect backdrop for the trophy, as excitement builds for the Lionesses’ World Cup send-off match against New Zealand at the Amex Stadium on Saturday 1 June.</p>

<p>Marzena Bogdanowicz, FA Head of Commercial and Marketing for Women’s Football said: “It’s fitting that the Women’s World Cup should come to Brighton and the Royal Pavilion is an amazing venue. We are looking forward to an exciting game in June and I hope everyone will come along to watch and give the Lionesses a great send off.”</p>

<p>Young footballers from Balfour Primary School, who are part of the Brighton and Hove Girls’ Football School Partnership, were invited to take part in the event, enjoying a special SSE Wildcats coaching session and having photographs with the trophy.</p>

<p class=""iframe-wrapper""><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHSRpLr9vH0"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>SSE Wildcats is The FA’s participation initiative, created to provide girls aged 5 to 11 with the opportunity to give football a try, welcoming over 20,000 participants across the country</p>

<p>“It’s such a great opportunity for the girls,” said teacher Matt Evans. “To come and have a coaching session and to actually see the Women’s World Cup Trophy is a once in a lifetime opportunity which I’m sure will inspire them in the future.”</p>

<p>Former Lioness Rachel Yankey, who was part of the 2007 and 2011 World Cup squads, added: “It’s fantastic to come here and see the World Cup, but more importantly, to see the girls from the local area playing football and realising the opportunities they are going to have, the pathways available to them and that playing football is an achievable career.”</p>

<p><a href=""http://thefa.com/LionessesTickets"">Tickets for the Lionesses vs New Zealand game are still available</a> at just £1 for children and £10 for adults.</p>

<p>England head coach Phil Neville said: “Excitement for the World Cup is definitely growing the closer we get to the finals and I can’t wait to bring the squad to Brighton for our send-off game before we head to France. We know we will get brilliant support from fans in the area and my players will be determined to put on a great show in our farewell match. Thank you in advance to everyone who has bought tickets to see us play.”</p>

<p>In 2021 there will be a great opportunity to see elite women’s football in the city as Brighton &amp; Hove is a host city for the UEFA Women’s European Championships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Designed by William Sawaya and hand-crafted by Milanese specialists Sawaya &amp; Moroni in 1998 in time for the 1999 tournament, the trophy, standing at 47cm and weighing 4.6kg, captures the athleticism, dynamism and elegance of international women’s football. Fitted with a modern, cone-shaped base that reinforces the uplifting spirit of the design, the trophy stretches skywards in the form of a spiral band, enclosing a football at the top. The trophy is made of bronze gold-plated, polished aluminium and Verde Candeias Granite. Engraved underneath its base are the names of each of the previous winners of the Women’s World Cup, cementing their place in Women’s World Cup history.</p>

<p>The beaches at Hove Lawns and Brighton central have been awarded Blue Flags for the 2019 bathing season.&nbsp;Saltdean beach was also&nbsp;recognised with a Seaside Award.</p>

<p>Blue flags are used to highlight coastal destinations that have achieved the highest quality in water, facilities, safety, environmental education and management.</p>

<p>Nick Hibberd, the council’s Executive Director for Economy, Environment &amp; Culture said: “We’re delighted that our beaches have been endorsed as among the UK’s best. The awards recognise the hard work and dedication of our beach cleaning teams and volunteer groups, our dedicated Seafront Office and Beach Lifeguard Team and our partners at Southern Water who are always looking at methods and measures to improve the water quality along our coastline.”</p>

<h2>Best beaches in England</h2>

<p>This year Keep Britain Tidy is presenting 208 awards to England’s best beaches, including 71 international Blue Flags and 137 Seaside Awards.</p>

<p>Keep Britain Tidy’s Chief Executive Allison Ogden-Newton said: “The success of the 156 beaches in reaching the very high standards demanded by both awards is testament to all those who have worked so hard to protect and improve our beaches – from beach managers and volunteers to local people and businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“When you enjoy a trip to a beach flying an international Blue Flag or Seaside Award, you know you are on one of the safest, cleanest and very best in the country.</p>

<h2>Keep the beach tidy</h2>

<p>Chris Ingall, Brighton &amp; Hove’s seafront operations manager added: “This is great recognition for everyone’s hard work. As a city we’re promoting the reduction of single use plastics and removal of waste from our beaches. There is still a lot to be done but the tide is turning on this global issue.</p>

<p>“My message to everyone who comes to our lovely beachfront is to please be considerate, use the bins provided, recycle where possible and leave the place tidy for everyone to enjoy!”<br />

37461,"<p>A local arts charity will be giving away a new book addressing the loneliness and stigma of living with an invisible health condition at Jubilee Library on Saturday 25 May.</p>

<p>‘Hidden Stories On Tour’ will be at the library between 10am and 3pm as part of Brighton Fringe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hidden Stories is a powerful, playfully illustrated graphic novel based on the everyday experiences of people living with conditions whose symptoms aren’t easily identifiable to others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book is published by Brighton arts charity Root Experience and looks at what it’s like to live with invisible conditions ranging from anxiety to autism, diabetes to chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visitors will be able to collect free copies of the book, meet some of the contributors, join in conversations and find out more about the project. There will also be a photography exhibition and interactive games that guide self-exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Hidden Stories journey&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Hidden Stories began as an interactive arts project in 2017, involving months of creative workshops in Sussex and across towns and cities in the south.</p>

<p>At the workshops, people with invisible conditions explored and shared the challenges of their day-to-day lives through storytelling, visual arts and soundscapes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millions of people worldwide are affected by these conditions daily yet often also face being isolated, misunderstood or stigmatised by society. Many are discouraged from opening up, and even seeking the support they need, for fear of being judged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Hidden Stories, Root Experience aims to inspire more people to speak out about their lives, while encouraging others to listen. That’s why the charity is giving away all 8,000 printed copies at eight free events across the south of England.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A self-help resource and conversation tool&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As well as offering a unique window into the lives of people living with hidden conditions, the book includes practical ideas for readers, such as writing a letter to the part of themselves, or condition, they keep hidden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simon Magnus, artistic director at Root Experience, said: “Hidden Stories is about helping people to find their voice, but also encouraging the compassion needed in others to hear and understand those voices.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hidden Stories project was made possible thanks to a £45,150 grant from the National Lottery’s Community Fund.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A free digital version is available to at <a href=""www.hiddenstories.co.uk"">www.hiddenstories.co.uk</a> and you can find out more at <a href=""www.rootexperience.org/hidden-project"">www.rootexperience.org/hidden-project</a>.&nbsp;</p>

37596,"<p>Teams of lifeguards will take up their posts on Brighton &amp; Hove’s beaches this weekend (Saturday 25 May) kicking off the summer season.</p>

<p>The 23 new recruits will be joining Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s seafront team, to help ensure millions of visitors enjoy a safe and happy time on the beach this summer.&nbsp;Many of the lifeguards will be familiar to regular beachgoers as they return to the job they enjoyed last year.</p>

<p>The new lifeguards will patrol the city’s beaches from the Marina to Hove Lagoon. During the summer holidays, from 20 July, lifeguards will be patrolling the beaches at Saltdean, Rottingdean, Ovingdean and further into Hove.</p>

<p>The team, of male and female lifeguards, have all successfully completed a beach lifeguard qualification and induction course acquiring a wide range of skills from assessing sea and weather conditions and dealing with beach hazards, to carrying out first aid and water rescues.</p>

<p>Every summer Brighton &amp; Hove’s lifeguards deal with hundreds of incidents and save many lives. During last year’s summer season they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>carried out 86 water rescues – around one every five days</li>
	<li>saved 24 lives</li>
	<li>administered first aid to around 238 beach goers</li>
	<li>helped find 226 missing people</li>
	<li>tackled 117 incidents of anti-social behaviour</li>

<p>“It must be a lucky stadium and I remember that game very well indeed.&nbsp;</p>

I’m sure we can give the Lionesses the best possible send off before they leave for France and the World Cup.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bronze is expecting a tough game against New Zealand, ranked 19th in the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“They might not be up there as a household football nation but they are a team that has been around for a very long time and should be taken seriously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“They have made almost every World Cup, work really hard for each other and are very fit.”</p>

<p>“I would swap my entire trophy cabinet for the World Cup,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“If I won one World Cup and nothing else I would have had a successful career and playing for your country is the highest honour you can have in football.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;“Winning it would be huge not just for us as individuals but for the history of football in England - it is everything that we want.”</p>

38251,"<p>The head of Brighton &amp; Hove’s library service has been recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list.</p>

<p>Sally McMahon, Head of Libraries &amp;&nbsp;Information Services, has been awarded the British Empire Medal for her services to libraries.</p>

<p>Sally has worked in the city’s libraries for more than 25 years. Her most significant achievement has been the success of the Jubilee Library, which has been in the top six most popular of all public libraries in the country every year since it opened in 2005.</p>

<h2>The heart of local communities</h2>

<p>Sally praised the work of library staff across the city and said: “I am thrilled to have been awarded the British Empire Medal for my contribution to libraries.</p>

<p>“My love of libraries started when I was at school and throughout my career I have been passionate about them. Libraries are at the heart of local communities, and support people’s learning, health and wellbeing in many different ways. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have always sought to deliver the best service possible, and promote the positive impact of libraries on local people.”</p>

<h2>Innovative services</h2>

<p>Among her achievements, Sally has introduced innovation and new technology to extend access to library buildings and library resources through, for instance, Libraries Extra giving most city libraries seven days a week access.</p>

<p>Council leader, Councillor Nancy Platts, said: “Sally’s honour is well deserved and a tribute to her dedication and commitment.”</p>

<p>There are 14 libraries across the city from Saltdean in the east to Portslade in the west. <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/leisure-and-libraries/libraries"">Visit our libraries pages for more information about library services in the city</a>.</p>

38641,"<p>An update on progress with moving the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums (RPM) into a stand-alone trust will be discussed by the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee next week.</p>

<p>Staff at the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums and other council colleagues are preparing for the transfer to trust and have made positive progress.</p>

<p>A project board was set up in March and specialist staff from the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums have taken part in business and staff planning and have helped set up property, legal and computer system arrangements for transfer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The expertise&nbsp;of staff will ensure the new trust is well-resourced and has the systems needed to offer the best service to residents and visitors.</p>

<h1>Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums Foundation</h1>

<p>Our proposal is to make the museums’ existing fundraising charity, the Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums Foundation, the ‘vehicle’ for the new Trust. To do that the foundation will be&nbsp;making some changes to its constitution and recruiting new members to its board to be sure that it has the diversity and experience needed for the governing body. A ‘Memorandum&nbsp;of Understanding’ has been drafted setting out the terms under which the trust will operate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foundation trustees as well as union representatives have also attended project board meetings to input into planning for transfer.</p>

<p>The foundation was established in 1972 as a charity and has helped buy many important items for the museums’ collection, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>King George IV’s only surviving grand piano</li>
	<li>A&nbsp;watercolour by JMW Turner</li>
	<li>The Elaine Evans Archaeology Gallery, which opened in Brighton Museum earlier this year.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Purpose of the trust</h1>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the Tourism, Development &amp; Culture Committee, said: “The purpose of the new trust is to make sure that the museum&nbsp;services will&nbsp;be provided to the same high standards over the long-term. We are proud to be custodians of such unique historic buildings and collections and to have such a highly regarded museums staff team who are key to delivering service success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Having staff share their expertise and be involved in the trust project as it progresses, and combining this with the strong fundraising track record of the RPM’s long established charity and it’s trustees, gives a fantastic basis for building on the successes of our museums service, our internationally-recognised buildings such as the Royal Pavilion and collections for future generations to enjoy.”</p>

<p>Last year an independent review concluded that a charitable trust model would be more financially sustainable for Brighton &amp; Hove’s museums than an in-house service in the mid to long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of the trust will be to ensure the museums service is sustainable and resilient and able to deliver the best possible offer to residents and visitors.- it will be able it to access&nbsp;new charitable income streams and operate outside of the constraints of annual local government budget setting.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Completion</h1>

<p>It is expected that work to transfer to the new Trust will be completed by April 2020.</p>

40066,"<p>The Mazda Electric Fountain in Brighton’s Victoria Gardens, unlit for 30 years, has been lovingly restored by a local lighting business.</p>

<p>It was originally given to the city in 1930 by Thomson-Houston Ltd following an exhibition and has stood in Victoria Gardens for nearly 90 years.</p>

<p>The fountain used to have lights weaving rainbow colours through jets of water that could reach up to 35 feet (10.6 metres). Using today’s technology with LED lighting, and DMX control (Digital Multiplex), the fountain now has an almost limitless colour palette and any colour scheme can be programmed. It will also be more robust and easier to maintain.</p>

<p class=""iframe-wrapper""><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XSlLpqAJbKs"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>Our building services team worked with transport officers on the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/a-vision-valley-gardens"">Valley Gardens project</a> and specialist lighting contractor <a href=""http://www.led-lighting.lighting/"">StarTek Lighting (UK) Ltd</a> to restore the fountain.</p>

<p>When the fountain was previously working and lit in the late 1980s, the lighting power consumption was around 27,000W. The new LED lights will use just 340W – an energy saving of almost 1000%.</p>

<h2>Labour of love</h2>

<p>Technical director Jake Sharpstone said: “It’s been a labour of love restoring this great fountain to its former glory, and a real pleasure to be able to gift light to this fountain and the people of Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>“Over a year ago when I saw on social media that the fountain might be removed from this prime spot I thought something had to be done to try and save it. I realised that as an owner of an LED lighting manufacturing company we could help save it by restoring the lighting.”</p>

<p>StarTek set about designing lights that would enhance the water jets, maintained over many years by Tim Fowler of Fowl Electrical Services and Peter More of PM Lighting Services.</p>

<p>Restoration so far has taken a year to complete – next year further work will be done to light up the rim of the fountain.</p>

<p>The fountain has a ring of five water spouts with ring jets around them, plus one powerful jet in the middle. All will be lit with additional lights around the rim for maximum effect.</p>

<h2>Petition by residents</h2>

<p>In 2015 the fountain was drained as there was no council budget to repair it at the time. Residents petitioned the council to re-instate the fountain but it was not until 2017 when a second petition was made that the council agreed to restore it as part of the Valley Gardens scheme.</p>

<p>StarTek offered to restore the lighting at no cost to the council. The company will be able to use the Mazda fountain to market their business.</p>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the city’s environment committee, said: “This is a great example of people power and social enterprise. The fountain is loved by residents, has been saved by them and restored by a Brighton company. The fountain is even better than before, adding extra colour to our colourful city.”</p>

<p>The council will service and maintain the fountain.</p>

<h2>Iconic feature</h2>

<p>Jake added: “We look forward to seeing people’s reaction to the new lighting as most people won’t have seen this fountain lit up as it was intended – we hope it will be a great addition to the many amazing, iconic features of Brighton and Hove.”</p>

<p>The Mazda fountain is in an area of Victoria Gardens that is currently fenced off for open space improvements as part of the Valley Gardens scheme. It will be in full view when the garden works are complete next spring and when the fountain is formally switched on for the public to enjoy.</p>

40151,"<p>One of the oldest elm trees in the country is to be felled after it was found to be infected with elm disease.</p>

<p>The Preston Park Twins, which are situated at the north end of Preston Park are around 400 years old, making them among&nbsp;the oldest elm trees in the UK. One of the trees has recently been found to be infected with elm disease and will now require removal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Stopping the spread of the disease</h2>

<p>It is likely that the tree became infected late last summer but had until now not displayed any symptoms. The disease is already into the trees root system and fast action is required to stop the disease spreading to its twin.</p>

<p>A programme of work&nbsp;started on&nbsp;Wednesday 3 July when contractors will dig trenches and sever the connecting roots that link the trees together. We are closely monitoring nearby trees so that any further problems can be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Protecting the city's National Elm Collection</h3>

<p>Every summer a battle is waged across the city against a tiny beetle carrying a deadly elm tree killing fungus known as Elm Disease or Dutch Elm Disease. Losses of trees to the disease have been manageable over the years thanks to a council-led control campaign.</p>

<p>The Elm remains the dominant tree throughout the city, with an estimated growing population of over 17,000 trees which we continue to add to.</p>

<h3><strong>How you can help protect our trees</strong></h3>

<p>The current hot weather will most likely result in further cases of diseased elms in the city. We urge residents to report any sick looking elms so that we can respond quickly.</p>

<p>One of the most likely ways for a tree to become infected by Elm Disease is via beetles breeding on elm logs stored in the area. These logs may have been brought in from other parts of East Sussex where there has been a massive rise in trees becoming infected and subsequent logs becoming available.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has also been a rapid increase in the number of wood burning stoves being sold in the area, increasing the risk of contaminated wood coming into the city.</p>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou said: “For many years, we have fully funded an internationally recognised control campaign to contain the spread of elm disease in the city. Our success has led to the city becoming the holder of the National Elm Collection and the last major bastion of the Elm in the UK.</p>

<p>“It is very sad that we have lost one of the magnificent Preston Park Twins to the disease this year. Overall, losses to elm disease have been manageable throughout the years and our elm population is always being added to.</p>

<p>“We thank residents for their continued support in spotting and reporting cases of elm disease which helps us act quickly to treat trees and reduce contamination.”</p>

<h3>Free inspection of trees, firewood and timber</h3>

<p>The council’s arboricultural team offer a free inspection of firewood and other timber. Similarly, if you have an elm tree in your garden that may be dead or dying, we are happy to come out and inspect it free of charge. Anyone wanting to use the service can contact the team by</p>

40321,"<p>Green Flags will once again be flying in seven Brighton &amp; Hove parks this summer as the council celebrates having some of the finest parks in the country.<br />
Easthill Park, Hove Park, Kipling Gardens, Preston Park, St Ann’s Well Gardens, Stoneham Park and The Level have all been re-awarded prestigious Green Flags for excellence. The national awards, handed out by environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy, recognise and reward the best parks and green spaces across the country.</p>

<h2>Excellent facilities</h2>

<p>The Green Flags are given to parks which are well maintained, provide a good community focus &nbsp;and have excellent facilities.<br />
St Ann’s Well Gardens in Hove flies the flag for the 19th year, while Preston Park, the city’s largest urban park, also celebrates a 19th successive year. Easthill Park in Portslade has picked up its 17th award, Hove Park is celebrating a 15th success while Kipling Gardens in Rottingdean has won its 12th award.<br />
Stoneham Park has picked up its 10th award and The Level is flying a Green Flag for the 6th year running.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>City-wide success</h2>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “Access to good quality open space is especially important in our densely populated city where many people don’t have private gardens, so it’s fantastic news that we will once again be flying seven Green Flags in parks in Brighton, Hove, Portslade and Rottingdean. It’s a real city-wide success story.<br />
“It’s a fitting tribute to our dedicated staff, Friends groups and volunteers who work tirelessly to make sure that the quality is maintained and our parks and gardens are a pleasure to visit all year round.”<br />
The parks are among a record-breaking number of UK parks and green spaces that have been awarded prestigious Green Flag Awards.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fantastic achievement</h2>

<p>Green Flag Award scheme manager Paul Todd said: “It’s fantastic that we have more Green Flag Awards in the UK than ever before, joined this year by 126 international winners.<br />
“Each flag honours the thousands of staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to maintain the high standards demanded by the Green Flag Award. We congratulate each and every winner on their fantastic achievement.”</p>

40426,"<p>Visit the spectacular garden at the Royal Pavilion this summer and you’ll be sure of a friendly welcome.</p>

<p>Volunteer Gardeners play a crucial part in maintaining the historic garden and Garden Greeters welcome visitors to the Royal Pavilion Estate.</p>

<p>The Royal Pavilion Garden has one full time Head Gardener and one part-time Assistant Gardener working with 20 volunteers.&nbsp;Together they maintain the historic garden surrounding Brighton’s iconic Royal Pavilion using natural planting techniques, growing plants from the Regency period maintained on organic principles.</p>

<h2>25th anniversary</h2>

<p>This year the Volunteer Gardeners are celebrating their 25th anniversary in the garden as their work began when the Regency garden was restored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the summer, visitors can find out more about the Royal Pavilion, the garden and surrounding buildings from one of our 26 volunteer Garden Greeters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watch our film about the Volunteer Gardeners and Garden Greeters.</p>

<p>The Garden Greeter scheme was set up by the Royal Pavilion Estate’s partners - The Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums, Brighton Dome &amp; Brighton Festival, the Chapel Royal, Pavilion Gardens Café and the Theatre Royal.</p>

<p>All the volunteers learn about the history of the estate and its buildings as well as the garden. It’s a great way of getting ‘behind the scenes’ and learning more about this special place.</p>

<p>They also have up to date information to share with visitors about what’s on across the estate over the summer season. In 2018, the Garden Greeters donated 1,150 hours to the Royal Pavilion Estate.</p>

40526,"<p>Work has begun on the restoration of Stanmer Park’s historic Walled Garden.</p>

<p>Representatives from Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Plumpton College, Buxtons Building Contractors and the South Downs National Park Authority gathered in the garden to witness the start of the project which will transform the city’s largest park.</p>

<p>The £5.1 million project is being funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and partners. Work is being carried out by Buxton Building Contractors Ltd.</p>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the city council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability committee said: “I’m delighted to be witnessing the start of this exciting new chapter in Stanmer Park’s fascinating history.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iimWVssGXg"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<h2>Volunteering opportunities</h2>

<p>“The community has been involved with Stanmer for many years and this project will build on their valuable work to protect and celebrate this precious green space asset, while hundreds of new education, volunteering and learning opportunities and activities will enhance everyone’s enjoyment of the park for generations to come.”</p>

<p>The Walled Garden, which is being leased to Plumpton College, was formerly Stanmer House’s kitchen garden and more recently used as the city council’s plant nursery. The project will see the area transformed into an attractive expertly designed garden with a new café and opportunities for horticultural teaching, learning and volunteering.</p>

<h2>Horticultural training</h2>

<p>James Hibbert, Deputy Principal at Plumpton College added: “This project represents a major step forward for us in continuing to deliver the highest quality horticultural training not just to school leavers but to all ages. The opportunity for our students to learn and work in such a unique environment will allow them to not just to get a job, but get the job that they want.</p>

<p>The Walled Garden also presents an opportunity to bring people together. The construction, planting and ongoing operation of the garden will allow local people and other visitors of all ages to get involved, to learn something new and to engage in a wider programme of events all aimed to bring the garden to life.”</p>

<h2>Frankland Monument restored</h2>

<p>The 20-hectare project area also includes building a new welcome centre at the Lower Lodges, offering park information, refreshments, public toilets and bike hire. The Grade II Frankland Monument will be restored, and an additional car park and new shared pedestrian/cycle path will also be created.</p>

<p>Claire Kerr, Countryside Policy Manager for the Eastern Downs, which includes Stanmer Park, said: “It’s exciting to see the Parks for People project under way.</p>

<p>“Stanmer Park is an important gateway into the South Downs National Park for both local residents, students and visitors to Brighton and Hove. This inspiring project will enhance the historic landscape, including its built heritage, archaeology and wildlife, and ensure it remains a place that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>“Stanmer Park represents a ‘bridge’ between the city and the National Park and we want more people from all backgrounds to be able to enjoy this wonderful asset.”</p>

<h2>Fantastic scheme</h2>

<p>Buxton Building Contractors are working closely with the council to ensure park visitors, residents and onsite businesses are kept informed of project progress and any temporary changes to public access.</p>

<p>David Norman, Managing Director of Buxton Building Contractors, said: “We are very pleased to be working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council on rejuvenating Stanmer Park. It’s a very challenging job but we will work closely with the consultants to deliver what will be a fantastic scheme.”</p>

40911,"<p>The FA has today selected the final venues for the UEFA European Women’s Championship, which will be played across eight English host cities in the summer of 2021, including Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>UEFA Women’s EURO 2021 promises to be a record-breaking tournament, with approximately 700,000 tickets due to be available for fans across the country and extensive coverage of every game of the tournament available on free-to-air television, radio and online.</p>

<p>The nine stadiums are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bramall Lane, Sheffield</li>
	<li>Brentford Community Stadium, London</li>
	<li>Brighton &amp; Hove Community Stadium, Brighton &amp; Hove</li>
	<li>Leigh Sports Village, Wigan &amp; Leigh</li>
	<li>Manchester City Academy Stadium, Manchester</li>
	<li>New York Stadium, Rotherham</li>
	<li>Stadium MK, Milton Keynes</li>
	<li>St. Mary’s Stadium, Southampton</li>
	<li>Wembley Stadium, London</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wembley final</h2>

<p>Two of the stadia are current FA Women’s Super League grounds and four of the venues, including Brighton &amp; Hove offer a capacity of over 30,000.&nbsp;<br />
The showpiece Final will be staged at Wembley Stadium, meaning the national stadium will host back-to-back men’s and women’s UEFA EURO Finals in 2020 and 2021.</p>

<p>As tournament hosts, England qualify automatically and will be joined by another 15 teams for the final tournament in July 2021. The official match schedule will be announced later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Excitement is building</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the council’s Tourism, Equalities, Communities &amp; Culture Committee, said: &nbsp;“The success of the Lionesses in this summer’s World Cup has given women’s football a tremendous boost and excitement is already building in our city for UEFA Women's EURO&nbsp;2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We were delighted to welcome the England team to the Brighton &amp; Hove Community&nbsp;Stadium back in June and we are proud to have been given the opportunity to host this prestigious event and help raise the profile of women’s football locally and nationally.”</p>

<h2>Growing the game</h2>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion women’s first-team manager Hope Powell said: “It’s exciting news for the city that the Brighton &amp; Hove Community Stadium has been chosen as one of the host stadiums for Euro 2021. When we played there in our FA WSL match against Arsenal last season you could see that there was a huge desire for people to watch women’s football in the region.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Hosting a tournament such as this will not only help grow our game nationally, but also on a more local level where matches are being played. I hope it inspires the next generation of girls to play the game and introduces a new audience to women’s football.”</p>

<h2>Showcasing skills</h2>

<p>Sussex County FA chief executive, Ken Benham, added: “We’re delighted that some of the finest female players from across Europe will be showcasing their skills right here in Sussex.</p>

<p>“The tournament has the power to inspire and we hope it will encourage more people into the game.</p>

<p>“We have opportunities for all ages and abilities to get involved with football, so we’re really looking forward to the increased exposure the championships will bring to the local area.”</p>

<h2>Huge opportunity</h2>

<p>Baroness Sue Campbell, The FA’s Director of Women’s Football, said: “The performance of the Lionesses this summer engaged the nation and helped to generate significant momentum in the women’s game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Looking ahead, hosting a home EURO in 2021 offers a huge opportunity for us to continue to push the profile of women’s football and to inspire more women and girls to get involved in the game. The confirmation of these nine venues is an important milestone for us as a host nation on our journey towards the final tournament in July 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I am confident that the selected cities and stadia will allow hundreds of thousands of fans across the country to attend matches and will also help to deliver an atmosphere befitting of a home European Championship to the nation.”</p>

<h2>Successful track record</h2>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove has a successful track record in hosting major sporting events, including the Rugby World Cup in 2015. In 2014 the city welcomed Stage 7 of the Tour of Britain bike race and the annual Brighton Marathon is the UK’s second largest.</p>

<p>The event will showcase the city to an international audience, supporting tourism and the local economy. In 2017, when England reached the semi-finals, the UEFA women’s Euro viewing figures reached a global audience of 165 million.&nbsp;</p>

40926,"<p>Plans to safeguard the future of the historic Royal Pavilion Garden and restore it to its former glory are back on track.</p>

<p>An updated bid&nbsp;for National Heritage Lottery funding was sent in this week. If successful, it'll mean work&nbsp;can move forward on&nbsp;progressing plans to improve and enhance the historic garden and apply for a full grant.</p>

<h2>Heritage importance</h2>

<p>The bid has been put together after a previous application was turned down earlier this year.</p>

<p>However, the council was encouraged to re-apply by the Heritage Lottery assessors who noted the heritage importance of the project, the need to improve the garden and praised the community involvement which backed the bid.</p>

<p>This included the results of a public consultation which attracted more than 1,300 responses.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conservation plan</h2>

<p>The Grade ll&nbsp;listed Royal Pavilion Garden was added to the Historic England at Risk Register in October 2017&nbsp;following concerns about high levels of visitor use, erosion of character and a general deterioration in the sense of history.</p>

<p>The council commissioned a conservation plan in 2018 which assessed risks to the garden’s heritage and provided a detailed plan of action&nbsp;to improve future management and operation, interpretation, community engagement, learning and access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plans include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improving&nbsp;access to the gardens for people with disabilities and a installing a new 'Changing Places' toilet</li>
	<li>New lighting and a secure boundary to address vandalism and anti-social behaviour</li>
	<li>Conserving&nbsp;and restoring&nbsp;listed lamp posts and balustrade, flowerbeds, paths, lawns and improving&nbsp;recycling, lighting and seating</li>
	<li>Overhauling the entrances, installing new gates and signs</li>
	<li>Creating&nbsp;a new programme of events, activities and volunteering opportunities</li>
	<li>Improving&nbsp;interpretation with maps and information boards, audio tours and an archival research project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Precious public space</h2>

<p>The council is bidding for £214,500 of National Heritage Lottery Funding to undertake the detailed planning needed for a major grant bid for £3.3 million.</p>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the council’s Tourism, Equalities, Communities &amp; Culture Committee said:</p>

<p>“The Royal Pavilion Garden is one of our most precious and well-loved public spaces, as well as having a unique&nbsp;history.&nbsp;This project is an opportunity to transform the way residents and visitors engage with its heritage.</p>

<p>“We are excited to see this beautiful garden restored to its former glory, removed &nbsp;from the Heritage at Rick Register and preserved for future generations.”</p>

<p>The National Heritage Lottery Fund is expected to make a decision in November. If agreed, the council will aim to submit the full bid in March 2021 with work starting in January 2022.</p>

<h2>Royal Pavilion Estate Project</h2>

<p>Improving and protecting the Royal Pavilion Garden is a key part of the Royal Pavilion Estate project where the council and Brighton Dome &amp; Brighton Festival are working together to reunify the estate and conserve its heritage.</p>

<p>Phase one of the project is underway. The Royal Pavilion Garden is part of phase two.</p>

40961,"<p>Leisure centres in Brighton &amp; Hove have set up ‘boot banks’ for people to donate football boots for play on a new pitch in Portslade.</p>

<p>The boots will be used by people who want to play football on the all- weather pitch but are unable to afford the footwear which has to meet a certain standard for the surface.</p>

<p>You can drop off your unwanted and outgrown boots at Stanley Deason and Withdean leisure centres as well as Portslade Sports Centre where the new pitch will be.</p>

<h2>Why we need your boots</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the Tourism, Equalities, Communities &amp; Culture Committee, said: “The boot bank came about as a result of winning funding for our wonderful new 3G pitch in Portslade. You need to wear specific boots to play on the surface and we all know sports boots are expensive, and children grow out of them quickly so we came up with the idea of a recycling bank for these boots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It means that everyone will be able to play on the new pitch and they can be used by the students at the local school, the Portslade Aldridge Community Academy. Football is incredibly popular in the city and access to a first-class 3G surface will be a great asset to the community, so we don’t want anyone to miss out.”</p>

<p>We are looking for all sizes of&nbsp;children’s and adult boots. They must be clean and undamaged and ideally have moulded studs. Screw studs can also be used.</p>

<p>The boot banks are a partnership between Freedom Leisure and the council.</p>

<h2>New 3G pitch</h2>

<p>Work has started on building the new 3G football pitch and is expected to open in late September. It is replacing the existing synthetic pitch, which had reached the end of its usable life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is funded by a grant from the Premier League, The FA and Government’s Football Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The £341,640 grant from the Football Foundation will provide a base for partner clubs Mile Oak Wanderers and Hangleton Rangers to offer their youth teams a first-class playing surface to grow and develop grassroots football. &nbsp;</p>

41016,"<p>A new bridleway in Hove will open up a missing link in the city’s footpath network, giving countryside access for walkers, cyclists and horse riders.</p>

<p>The new path, which opened last week, links rights of way on Benfield Hill and the New Barn Farm area with the Dyke Railway trail and beyond and&nbsp;has been created by West Hove Golf course,&nbsp;Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s countryside team and the South Downs National Park Authority.</p>

<p><img alt=""Councillor Anne Pissaridou opens the bridleway with members of the public."" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""525"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/news-benfield-hill-bridleway-01.jpg"" width=""700"" /></p>

<p>The opportunity to open the path arose after West Hove Golf Club approached the SDNPA for planning permission for an acoustic bund, buffering the course from the A27. Creating the new bridleway and opening up the surrounding access land was one of the planning conditions.</p>

<h2>'Missing link'</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;bridleway is one of the ‘Missing Links’ identified in the council’s original Rights of Way Improvement Plan&nbsp;drawn up in 2007. This is a statutory plan that every Highways Authority must have to show how it intends to improve access for diverse users.</p>

<p>Missing Links are gaps in the system of paths that, if filled, would greatly improve the connectivity of the whole network and were identified by members of the Local Access Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forum members, including representatives from walking, cycling, horse riding and land management, have been working for the last 10 years to help plug these gaps and have welcomed the opening of this new link in the bridleway network.</p>

<h2>Partnership working</h2>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, said: “I am delighted that by working in partnership with the National Park Authority and West Hove Golf Club we have been able to open this missing link and create an attractive and high quality east-west route, north of the A27 for cyclists, horse riders and walkers.</p>

<p><img align=""right"" alt=""Members of the public using the bridleway."" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""337"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/news-benfield-hill-bridleway-02.jpg"" width=""253"" /></p>

<p>“The opening of this new bridleway is an important step toward the council delivering on the targets of its new Rights of Way Improvement Plan (2017 – 2027) which aims to provide: &nbsp;‘A well connected network, more user friendly and more beneficial to local people.""</p>

<p>The new route will also help increase biodiversity in the area after wildflowers have been planted in the chalk grassland. These flowers are a fantastic source of pollen and nectar for bees, butterflies, hoverflies and other insects. Hibernacula, which are animal refuges, have also been created to support several reptile species.</p>

<h2>Wildlife corridor</h2>

<p>Andrew Lee, Director of Countryside Policy and Management at the South Downs National Park Authority, said: “This project significantly improves the rights of way network in the National Park’s Hangleton and Portslade area and creates a wonderful opportunity for the public to enjoy this new species-rich chalk grassland. It also creates an important wildlife corridor to help support biodiversity between existing nature sites.</p>

<p>“The chalk grassland will be managed by cut and collect for a few years and, ultimately, the plan is for the land to be grazed by sheep. This will be a better way of managing the site and will be much more productive for the biodiversity of the area.”</p>
","We're delighted to have worked with West Hove Golf Club and South Downs National Park to open a new bridleway and provide more countryside access for walkers, horse riders and cyclists.

41056,"<p>Experts from the world renowned Millenium Seedbank at Wakehurst&nbsp;joined forces with council conservation staff last week to gather wildflower seeds in Stanmer Park.</p>

<p>Using specialist harvesting equipment, the experts collected a variety of ‘just ripened’ wildflower seeds from Marquee Brow – an area known for its rare, but locally abundant, chalk downland-loving flowers and rich variety of insects.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""2304"" src=""/sites/default/files/P1030857.JPG"" width=""3072"" /></p>

<p>The seeds will be put into storage for the winter, ready to be re-seeded next year as part of the park’s restoration and landscaping improvements.</p>

<p>Surveys were also undertaken to get detailed baseline information about&nbsp;&nbsp;which of the many wildflowers on Marquee Brow were producing seed to be captured by the brush harvester.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seeds will&nbsp;be re-planted in the Spring in key parts of the park including the Lower Lodges car parking areas.</p>

<h2>Rich variety</h2>

<p>Ted Chapman, Co-ordinator of the UK Native Seed Hub at Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank said: “We were delighted to find such a rich variety of species growing and producing seed at Stanmer Park, including many chalk grassland specialists typical of the South Downs.</p>

<p>“Our next job is to clean the seed and store it in our vaults at -20c, ensuring it stays in peak health until the site is ready to sow. The Seed Bank is home to seed from all over the world, but it is always great to get involved in practical conservation projects on our doorstep.”</p>

<h2>Future-proofing</h2>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the city council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee added: “This partnership with an organisation of Kew’s standing is a wonderful example of environmental future-proofing in action.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to seeing increasing numbers of flourishing wildflowers and insects at Stanmer Park in future.”</p>

<p>The city council hopes to increase the amount of wildflower planting by adding some grown by long-time Stanmer resident John Gapper, and volunteers, who grow wildflowers at Stanmer Park as part of the newly-formed Wildflower Conservation Society (Brighton &amp; Beyond) group.</p>

<h2>Chalk downland</h2>

<p>City council conservation staff have previously worked with project partners from Kew and will continue to work with them to monitor the areas and the plants in coming years.</p>

<p>This will help to build a clear picture of the health of this important and extensive chalk downland habitat at Stanmer Park.</p>

<p>There will also be opportunities for community volunteers to get involved with ongoing identification and monitoring of the park’s wildflowers and other wildlife, as part of the park’s Activity Plan.</p>

41146,"<p>When trainee tree surgeon Leo Lamont joined the council back in the late 1970s one of his first jobs was to plant a line of elm saplings in Preston Park.</p>

<p>Fast forward over 40&nbsp;years, and Leo is back in the park but this time with a heavy heart – to fell one of the trees infected with elm disease.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""3024"" src=""/sites/default/files/Leo%201.jpg"" width=""4032"" /></p>

<p>“It’s heart-breaking to be cutting down one the trees I planted so many years ago, which had grown into beautiful mature elm,” said Leo.</p>

<p>“Once it takes hold, elm disease can be devastating and the only chance of stopping the stop the spread is to remove the tree.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Battling&nbsp;the elm beetle</h2>

<p>This year, the city has seen several of its most significant and stunning elms fall victim to elm disease. Among them is one of the famous Preston Twin elms which is due to be felled later this month.</p>

<p>The 400 year old tree, one of the oldest in the UK , could not be saved after the disease reached its root system. Felling will hopefully stop the disease spreading to its twin.</p>

<p>Every summer the council’s arboriculture team wages a battle across the city against the tiny beetle which carries the deadly elm tree killing fungus known as Elm Disease or Dutch Elm Disease. Losses of trees to the disease have been manageable over the years thanks to a council-led control campaign.</p>

<p>“We urge residents to report any sick looking elms so that we can respond quickly,” said arboriculturist Neil Brothers.</p>

<h2><strong>Elm log danger</strong></h2>

<p>He added that one of the most likely ways for a tree to become infected by Elm Disease is via beetles breeding on elm logs stored in the area. “These logs may have been brought in from other parts of East Sussex where there has been a massive rise in trees becoming infected and subsequent logs becoming available.</p>

<p>“In recent years, there has also been a rapid increase in the number of wood burning stoves being sold in the area, increasing the risk of contaminated wood coming into the city.”</p>

<h2>Free advice</h2>

<p>The council’s arboriculture team offers a free inspection of firewood and other timber. Similarly, if you have an elm tree in your garden that may be dead or dying, we are happy to come out and inspect it free of charge. Anyone wanting to use the service can contact the team by:</p>

<p>The council is inviting proposals to let the sites for the next 25 years to provide golf and/or other leisure uses.</p>

<p>The land is currently used for two 18-hole golf courses and both sites sit within the South Downs National Park.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, the golf courses have seen a fall in season ticket holders, golf usage and golf club membership, mirroring a national picture of fewer people playing golf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>City councillors have approved the marketing of the sites as golf courses as well as inviting other leisure proposals. In addition ‘in-house’ options are also being considered, specifically in relation to ‘rewilding.’</p>

<p>A market assessment identified the following potential other leisure uses of the sites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Outdoor activity centre</li>
	<li>Education</li>
	<li>Camping or glamping</li>
	<li>Events venue</li>
	<li>Restaurant/café</li>
	<li>Wellness centre</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exciting opportunity</h2>

<p>Councillor Alan Robins, chair of the city’s Tourism, Equalities, Communities and Culture committee, said: “This is an exciting opportunity to provide a wonderful outdoor experience for our residents and visitors. By inviting proposals on long term leases for golf and/or other leisure uses we hope to receive a range of options to give both courses a sustainable future.”</p>

<p>The council has successfully marketed other leisure sites on long term leases which brought forward some interesting proposals. These included the Yellowave Beach Volleyball Centre on the seafront and the Sea Lanes proposal on Madeira Drive.</p>

<p>Hollingbury and Waterhall golf courses are owned by the council and are currently managed externally by MyTime Active a registered charity operating as a social enterprise to promote wellbeing. The contract ends next March.</p>

<h2>Numbers falling</h2>

<p>Participation in golf has declined in recent years. Factors which are considered to be causing the decline include the oversupply of courses, the length of time it takes to play a full 18 hole round (approximately 4 hours), that golf is relatively expensive to play, the increased participation in other recreational opportunities such as cycling and a lack of diversity of golf participants &nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last eight years season ticket holders have fallen significantly. Season ticket holders provide the core usage for each course and are very important for viability of a course. In Brighton &amp; Hove there are a large number of courses all competing in a very small geographical area. A nearby course in Hassocks has recently closed.</p>

<p>Current operator Mytime Active has significant experience of operating a range of golf courses on behalf of local councils and has led a number of initiatives to encourage more participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has included foot golf at Waterhall, improved catering and function facilities at Hollingbury and various golf development initiatives. However the financial benefits of these have not been able to compensate for the drop in golf income.</p>

41311,"<p>Budding young soccer stars from Portslade and Mile Oak are kicking off the new season with a fantastic state-of-the-art 3G all weather pitch.</p>

<p>The youngsters, gathered at the pitch for the official opening this week, which also marked National Fitness Day.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""1785"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/HB240919A-11.jpg"" width=""2689"" /></p>

<p>The new surface has been funded by the Premier League, the FA and government's Football Foundation, and Brighton &amp; Hove City Council.</p>

<p>After netting a £341,640 grant from the Football Foundation, work began in June to replace the previous synthetic pitch which had reached the end of its usable life.</p>

<h2><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""1734"" src=""/sites/default/files/news/HB240919A-18.jpg"" width=""2613"" /></h2>

<p>The pitch was officially opened by Portslade Councillor Alan Robins, Chair of the Tourism, Economy, Environment &amp; Culture Committee.</p>

<p>“The old pitch was well used but worn out and in dire need of replacement,” he said. “We now have a fantastic, first-class playing surface to grow and develop grassroots football and improve the health and physical activity of residents in the city.</p>

<p>“I’d like to thank the Premier League, the FA and government’s Football Foundation for their support which has made this possible.”</p>

<p>Operated by Freedom Leisure on behalf of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, the pitch will be used by students from Portslade Aldridge Community Academy (PACA) who are based on the site.</p>

<p>It will also provide a base for partner clubs Hangleton Rangers and Mile Oak Wanderers and their 28 youth football teams.</p>

<h2>Improving health and fitness</h2>

<p>It is hoped the new pitch and associated football development plan will be able to support the delivery of community based sessions for improving health and fitness for all age groups including supporting sessions for local children or adults with disabilities from the local community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul Thorogood, Chief Executive of the Football Foundation, added: “Grassroots sport plays an important role in communities across the UK, creating opportunities for people of all ages and backgrounds. That’s why I am delighted that Portslade Sports Centre has now opened its state-of-the-art 3G pitch, thanks to investment from the Football Foundation.</p>

<p>“Continuing to improve access to high-quality facilities like this one is a key aim for the Premier League, The FA and the Government. Delivered by the Football Foundation, their funding supports projects for clubs and organisations all over the country and is helping to boost the number of people benefiting from sport through better facilities.”</p>

33396,"<p>Six law breakers who were caught dropping litter on the street have been fined a total of £5004 – or £834 each.</p>

<p>The huge fines were issued at Brighton Magistrates Court after the offenders failed to pay the initial £75 fixed penalty notice and then didn’t attend court, despite being summoned.</p>

<p>The offences took place on Junction Road and Boundary Road, Portslade, and Western Road, Brighton.</p>

<p>It is against the law for people to:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;drop or throw away litter, including cigarette butts<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fly-tip or fly-post<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;not pick up their dog's mess if they foul in public space</p>

<p>Anyone caught is given an on-the-spot fine between £75 and £300, depending on the type of offence.</p>

<p>If the fine isn’t paid within 28 days, the case goes to court where the offender will face a higher fine plus costs.</p>

<p>In this case, each of the six defendants didn’t pay within the time or bother to turn up to court. They were fined £440, told to pay £350 costs plus a £44 victim surcharge, totalling £834 each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “We’re determined to stamp out littering and these convictions show we take this type of crime very seriously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added: “We will not sit back and watch our beautiful city become dirty because someone can’t be bothered to find a bin for their cigarette butt or rubbish, or clean up after their dog.</p>

<p>“Nor will we stand aside and let people fly-tipping their unwanted items beside a communal bin, expecting the council to take them away at the expense of other council tax payers.</p>

<p>“We will continue to gather evidence and fine offenders. If they fail or refuse to pay, we will take them to court where they will be handed much bigger fines and a criminal prosecution, as these offenders have found out.”</p>

<h2>Offenders who don’t pay the fine</h2>

<p>By law, anyone caught littering must give their full name and address to the council’s enforcement officers who then verify the person using electronic ID verification systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Failure to give the correct name and address can lead to a £1,000 fine and a criminal conviction.</p>

<p>If the offender then fails to pay the fixed penalty notice, the case progresses to the local Magistrates Court with the maximum penalty of £2,500.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As littering is a criminal offence and not a civil offence, anyone found guilty will not only face a bigger fine than the original £75, they will also have a criminal conviction against their name.<br />

34791,"<p>Great news! We’ve launched a fantastic new <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-a-z"">A to Z guide on how you can reduce, reuse, recycle or dispose</a> of almost 180 different materials.</p>

<p>The easy-to-use guide gives detailed explanations of what to do with everything from aerosols to mattresses and nappies to Tetra Paks, to ensure we’re all being as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>

<p>The A to Z also gives advice on what to do with materials like rubble, plasterboards, asbestos, bathroom fittings, furniture, white goods, batteries and metal.</p>

<p>The guide launches our new drive to help residents recycle the correct things far more. In turn, this will help reduce the large number of recycling bins that we collect which are contaminated with non-recyclable products.</p>

<h2><strong>Why a guide is very helpful</strong></h2>

<p>We all want a cleaner city and a better world, and recycle as much as we can and with the best intentions. We all know we can recycle items like plastic bottles, paper, cardboard and glass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you’re unsure about what to do with specific items or materials, and put the wrong ones in your recycling, this can lead to your bin being contaminated and possibly being taken to waste rather than be recycled.</p>

<p>Using the guide, which can be easily accessed online by phone, computer or tablet, means contamination of your recycling can be avoided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also means items and materials can be reduced, or reused by yourself or someone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “I’m sure many of us have been in the situation where we don’t know what to do with a certain material or item. Do we put it in our recycling? Bin it? Give it away?</p>

<p>“Now, armed with our new A to Z, we’ll all be able to do the right thing and help protect our city and our planet better, and ensure we’re making the best use of the materials we no longer want or need.”</p>

<h2><strong>How to use the guide</strong></h2>

<p>You should log onto <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-0"">www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/recycling</a>. Click on the ‘<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-a-z"">Recycling A to Z</a>’ link and you can then search 179 items alphabetically.</p>

<p>The guide uses what’s called the ‘waste hierarchy’, starting with how to firstly <strong>reduce</strong> the use of a material or item, then how to <strong>reuse</strong> it, then <strong>recycle</strong> and finally, when none of the others can be done, the best way to <strong>dispose</strong> of it.</p>

<p>In the case of plastic bags, first of all the A to Z suggests using a reusable bag rather than a plastic one. If that can’t be done, the next suggestion is how to reuse the plastic bag, for instance as a bin liner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If that’s not possible, we say whether it can be recycled – plastic bags cannot – and then how it should be disposed of.</p>

<h2><strong>Other items and materials</strong></h2>

<p>As materials vary enormously, the use of <strong>reduce, reuse, recycle, dispose</strong> varies also.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, we only say that styrofoam, which is used in packaging, cannot be recycled but should be disposed of in your household rubbish. However, textiles can be reused or recycled.</p>

<p>Cllr Mitchell added: “Although our recycling rate is the highest it’s ever been, we must aim much higher. We’re hoping this guide is a game changer in helping us all to recycle more and reduce contamination.”</p>

<h2>“A new beginning for the council”</h2>

<p>Cllr Gill Mitchell, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “We’ve brought the officers in-house to ensure there is clearer management of the team and greater accountability.</p>

<p>“As this is a new beginning for the council and the service, we’re taking the opportunity to educate people on their responsibility for keeping our beautiful city clean and tidy.</p>

<p>“We also want to ensure we’re being fair with everyone so will be approaching people in the street, including residents, tourists and students, with advice on how to avoid being fined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We will also be dropping in on colleges, universities and language schools to ask them to remind their students on a regular basis how to be fine free.”</p>

<h2>Cigarette butts are litter too</h2>

<p>Cllr Mitchell added: “There is still a large number of people who think throwing a cigarette butt on the ground or down a drain isn’t littering. But the first litters our streets and the second can add to clogging up our drainage system. But anyone caught after our two week education programme will face a £75 fine.</p>

<p>“There are also lots of people who think leaving items they don’t want any more on the street, like furniture, mirrors or mattresses, is fine. But this is fly-tipping and a £300 fine will be issued.”</p>

<p>The 3GS jet black uniform – which some people say they found intimidating – has been replaced with a light blue jacket and black trousers. The officers will still wear body cameras for the public’s and their own protection, and can use any footage if fines are disputed.</p>

<p>The officers will begin issuing fines after the two week education drive.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<h2>Sustainability and Carbon Reduction Investment Fund</h2>

<p>The fund will support the development and delivery of citywide initiatives which aim to reduce carbon emissions, build resilience against the effects of climate change and protect and enhance biodiversity. New revenue funding will be spent on developing the capacity of the Sustainability Team to deliver a pipeline of citywide projects and initiatives.</p>

<h2>Areas for investment&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Resources will be directed in areas such as:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>energy efficiency and renewable energy</li>
	<li>biodiversity enhancement</li>
	<li>sustainable travel&nbsp;</li>
	<li>green Infrastructure and Sustainable Urban Drainage&nbsp;</li>
	<li>moving towards a Circular Economy&nbsp;</li>
	<li>healthy, sustainable and fair food for all</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reducing carbon emissions&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Progress has been made in recent years to reduce carbon emissions and the per capita CO2 emissions for the city published in 2018 show a significant reduction of 40.6% from the 2005 base rate. If this rate of progress is maintained, the city’s 42% reduction target for 2020 and the 80% target for 2050 will be exceeded.</p>

<h2>Ongoing projects</h2>

<p>The council has also been developing key work streams around climate mitigation by implementing new renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. These include increasing the amount of solar PV on corporate buildings, the rolling out of electric vehicle charging points and exploring new ways to harness solar power on our housing stock.</p>

<h2>A sustainable economy</h2>

<p>Sustainability is one of the five themes which underpin the new economic strategy to 2024 and which are vital to delivering economic growth, creating prosperity and providing a greater quality of life for all. The strategy promotes a focus on a circular and sustainable economy, pushing business and community engagement in achieving city resilience and climate change.</p>

<h2>Monitoring progress</h2>

<p>A further report outlining the process for agreeing and assessing projects that are delivered through the Sustainability and Carbon Reduction Investment Fund will be brought to the Policy, Resources &amp; Growth Committee meeting on 11 July 2019.</p>

<p>From today, Monday&nbsp;8 April, the officers will be issuing fines, known as Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) - £75 for littering and £300 for fly-tipping.</p>

<p>Over the last fortnight the officers have issued friendly warnings to around 1,500 businesses, big and small, to advise and remind them of their legal responsibilities on getting rid of their waste.</p>

36636,"<p>The council’s Cityclean team has cleared the A27 and A23 verges of rubbish, collecting a massive 4 tonnes of waste along the way.</p>

<p>From paper cups to a double mattress, the team picked up the equivalent of 500 black bin bags of rubbish that people have either thrown from their vehicle, fly-tipped or that had been blown onto the grass verges.</p>

<p>The crews worked for three nights from 10pm until 4am, when the traffic is quieter, on the stretch of road from Falmer junction to the Southwick tunnel – a total of 13.6 miles.</p>

<p>The clean-up also extended to part of the A23 the council is responsible for, north of the London Road roundabout to the stone gate pillars, known as the Patcham Pylons, and the A23 sliproads.</p>

<p>The A27 runs through seven different local authority areas, with each council responsible for litter picking the verges at the side of a particular stretch.</p>

<p>Maintenance of the road is the responsibility of Highways England, as is the cleaning and management of the central reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rachel Chasseaud, the council’s assistant director of City Environment, said: “Keeping the verges of the A27 and A23 clean and tidy is a major job as they can accumulate a lot of rubbish in a very short time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There are also many issues the city council faces in clearing the waste, including the safety of our staff and those driving on this very busy road, the need for lane closures and the costs of doing this, and trying to keep traffic disruption to a minimum.</p>

<p>“There is also the added complication of existing road works taking place, the seven different local authorities operating together and working with Highways England to ensure everything is carried out according to its rules and regulations.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rachel added: “Our team has carried out a fantastic job, and 500 bags of waste shows how much people are throwing away their rubbish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“But the best way to keep the roads verges clean and litter free is for people to stop fly-tipping and throwing rubbish out of their cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This would make a massive difference to the look of the road and the environment as well as saving the council, and therefore our council tax payers, a lot of money.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council also recently met a newly-formed group called the A27 Clean-Up Campaign which is helping keep the road’s verges tidy.<br />

36866,"<p>A team of specialist abseiling cleaners have removed a huge pile of rubbish from Madeira Terrace.</p>

<p>We&nbsp;called in Brighton-based company Sussex Rope Access to clean up the Terrace’s mid-level as pedestrian access onto the raised walkway has been deemed unsafe by structural engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the area being fenced off, rough sleepers climbed over the barriers to set up camps. When they moved on, they left dangerous needles and other drug paraphernalia, plus mattresses, sleeping bags, bedding, supermarket trolleys and other rubbish.</p>

<p>Rachel Chasseaud, the council’s assistant director of City Environment, said: “Our structural engineers have told us that the mid-level of Madeira Terrace is very dangerous for people to walk on or have machinery on as it could collapse.</p>

<p>“We fenced the area off to make clear no one was allowed, so it was a real concern that rough sleepers had set up camp and then left piles of rubbish. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Some people walking on Marine&nbsp;Parade above the terrace walkway had also tossed rubbish into the fenced off area. It was too dangerous for our staff to work on the walkway, so we called in Sussex Rope Access who are professionals in getting into difficult areas by abseiling.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The specialist team removed the waste from the mid-level and transferred it to ground level where Cityclean staff waited with a truck to take the rubbish away. The process will now be repeated on an ‘as and when’ basis until the area can be made safe.</p>

<p>Rachel added: “Everyone has done a brilliant job and removed a lot of dangerous items like drug needles and other potentially harmful items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Committed volunteers had contacted us to say they were prepared to go in and remove the waste, but as a responsible local authority, we couldn’t allow any member of the public to put themselves in danger.”</p>

36916,"<p>The council’s Cityclean team has cleared the A27 and A23 verges of rubbish, collecting a massive four&nbsp;tonnes of waste along the way.</p>

<p>From paper cups to a double mattress, the team picked up the equivalent of 500 black bin bags of rubbish that people have either thrown from their vehicle, fly-tipped or that had been blown onto the grass verges.</p>

<p>The crews worked for three nights from 10pm until 4am, when the traffic is quieter, on the stretch of road from Falmer junction to the Southwick tunnel – a total of 13.6 miles.</p>

<p>The clean-up also extended to part of the A23 the council is responsible for, north of the London Road roundabout to the stone gate pillars, known as the Patcham Pylons, and the A23 sliproads.</p>

<p>The A27 runs through seven different local authority areas, with each council responsible for litter picking the verges at the side of a particular stretch.</p>

<p>Maintenance of the road is the responsibility of Highways England, as is the cleaning and management of the central reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rachel Chasseaud, the council’s assistant director of City Environment, said: “Keeping the verges of the A27 and A23 clean and tidy is a major job as they can accumulate a lot of rubbish in a very short time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There are also many issues the city council faces in clearing the waste, including the safety of our staff and those driving on this very busy road, the need for lane closures and the costs of doing this, and trying to keep traffic disruption to a minimum.</p>

<p>“There is also the added complication of existing road works taking place, the seven different local authorities operating together and working with Highways England to ensure everything is carried out according to its rules and regulations.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rachel added: “Our team has carried out a fantastic job, and 500 bags of waste shows how much people are throwing away their rubbish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“But the best way to keep the road’s verges clean and litter free is for people to stop fly-tipping and throwing rubbish out of their cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This would make a massive difference to the look of the road and the environment as well as saving the council, and therefore our council tax payers, a lot of money.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council also recently met a newly-formed group called the A27 Clean-Up Campaign which is helping keep the road’s verges tidy.</p>

37471,"<p>A total of 12 people have been fined by Brighton Magistrates for a series of offences including littering and using a disabled Blue Badge illegally.</p>

<p>The magistrates handed out fines totalling £2745 to the lawbreakers, some of who didn’t bother to attend their hearing and therefore faced higher penalties.</p>

<p>Each person now has a criminal conviction which could affect their jobs, getting insurance, loans and travelling abroad.</p>

<p>Sophie Wakefield, of The Avenue, Brighton, pleaded guilty to 2 counts of using a blue badge belonging to a person who had died more than a year earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was ordered to pay a total of £430 made up of £200 plus £200 costs and a £30 victim surcharge.</p>

<p>Magistrates also issued fines of £215 (made up of £100 with £85 costs and £30 victim surcharge) to nine litterbugs who chose not to attend court. The original Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) was £75. However, court action was taken after the nine ignored two reminders issued by the council.</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;John Betsworth (53) of Glenwood Gardens, Waterlooville</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chris Collis (30) of Chancel Close, Bristol&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dean Daniel (27) of Windermere Crescent, Worthing&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aaron John Kemp (31) of Beaconsfield Villas, Brighton&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;John Baptiste Laneel (19) of West Street, Brighton&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anthony McCloskey (27) of Hall Quay, Great&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shereen Jasmine Phillips (32) of Walrond Avenue, London&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Martin Reybun (30) of Preston Park Avenue, Brighton&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel Winne (46) &nbsp;of Hove Park Villas, Hove</p>

<p>Two other litterbugs did attend court and received a lesser overall fine of £190, made up of £75 with £85 costs and £30 victim surcharge.</p>

<p>They are:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Grego Kertesz (22) of Honeysuckle Close, Eastbourne&nbsp;</p>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Emma Martini (43) of Wilbury Road, Hove</p>

<p>Nick Hibberd, the council’s executive director of economy, environment &amp; culture, said: “This sends out a clear message to people who throw or drop litter or use a disabled Blue Badge fraudulently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It also serves as a strong and no-nonsense reminder that if someone does commit a crime they should pay the fine early and not ignore our reminder letters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Hoping the issue will magically go away doesn’t happen and will always mean the issue escalating to the Magistrates court. That means the fine will be almost three times higher and possible even more. On top of that people then have a criminal conviction on their record.”<br />

37836,"<p>An important conservation milestone will be reached in Brighton &amp; Hove this weekend.</p>

<p>May 31 marks the 50th anniversary of the first conservation areas to be set up in the city following the passing of the Civic Amenities Act in 1967.</p>

<h2>33 conservation areas&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The new legislation defined a conservation area as: ‘an area of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance.’&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brunswick Town and Cliftonville were the first areas to be designated, and the city now has 33 conservation areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of the new conservation areas was to cover whole areas, ranging from town centres to squares, terraces, groups of buildings and villages, rather than individual properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“While the listing of buildings protected period properties and architectural style, it was recognised that it was not just individual buildings by themselves that mattered,” said Tim Jefferies, principal planning officer for the council.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""4176"" src=""/sites/default/files/Waterloo%20Street%2C%20Hove.jpg"" width=""6404"" /></p>

<p>“Brunswick Town was an obvious candidate for designation, as one of the finest examples of Regency and early Victorian planning and architecture in the country,” he added. “Many of its finest terraces had already been listed in 1950, including the grade I listed set-pieces of Brunswick Square and Terrace.”</p>

<p>Cliftonville, created in the 1850s as an independent new suburb, and absorbed into Hove in 1874 became the second conservation area.</p>

<p>“The Cliftonville conservation area covered the mainly semi-detached dwellings between Albany Villas and Osborne Villas, together with listed buildings on Courtney Terrace and the larger-scale Medina Terrace,” said Tim. He added that in 1985 the conservation area was extended to cover the terraces of Hova Villas and Ventnor Villas to the north.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""3780"" src=""/sites/default/files/Osborne%20Villas%2C%20Hove.jpg"" width=""5927"" /></p>

<p>Since then both conservation areas have been given Article 4 Directions which control development, allowing them to evolve without losing important architectural details.&nbsp;<br />
Restrictions over the display of estate agents boards have also helped to keep streets tidier.</p>

<p>In 1970 a further six conservation areas were designated and there are now 33 conservation areas in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Protecting our heritage</h1>

<p>Planning policy councillor Gill Williams said: “It’s great to be celebrating 50 years of creating conservation areas in our historic city.</p>

<p>“This important legislation, which covers whole areas of the city, has meant that so much of our rich heritage is now protected.</p>

<p>“We will continue to review these areas and - through local planning policy, character statements and management&nbsp;plans - ensure that a robust framework is in place to preserve and enhance them for the next 50 years.”</p>

38791,"<p>New fines for extreme anti-social behaviour could soon be brought in by the city council.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If next week’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability committee (ETS) agrees, people caught spitting, urinating or defecating in public places will receive an on-the-spot fine of £75.</p>

<p>The move comes after a rise in complaints to the council around these types of activities.</p>

<h2>'Bad behaviour will not be tolerated'</h2>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, the new chair of the council’s ETS committee, said: “Spitting, urinating and defecating are regarded by a vast majority of people as anti-social habits and can have a number of dangerous health implications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“With a rise in these activities coupled with a surge in the number of complaints we receive, we want to make it clear that this behaviour will not be tolerated.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>At present, the council’s environmental enforcement officers only issue Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) fines to individuals for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>littering&nbsp;</li>
	<li>fly-tipping&nbsp;</li>
	<li>fly-posting&nbsp;</li>
	<li>graffiti&nbsp;</li>
	<li>dog poo&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>the uncontrolled distribution of leaflets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping the city clean and tidy</h2>

<p>These are given out, by law, in a bid to keep the city’s streets,&nbsp;parks and open spaces clean and tidy.</p>

<p>But spitting, urinating and defecating will now be included in the list, with fines being issued under Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>

<p>On 1 March this year, the council brought the environmental enforcement team in-house after it ended its contract with controversial contractor 3GS.</p>

<p>Since then the team has issued just over 240 fines, mainly to individuals for littering and businesses for illegally dumping waste.</p>

<p>Cllr Pissaridou added: “It’s necessary to take this enforcement action as these types of anti-social behaviour affect us all.</p>

<p>“They have a harmful effect on the city and add to the already huge amount of cleaning, collection and disposal of rubbish and waste.</p>

<p>“With almost 300,000 residents and more than 11 million visitors a year, keeping the city clean will never be an easy task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“But I promise that in my new role I will do everything I can to make it happen.”</p>

<h2>Fines money reinvested to improve our rubbish and recycling services</h2>

<p>The environmental enforcement service&nbsp;is funded by income raised from the FPNs. Any extra money from collecting fines is reinvested into improving rubbish and recycling services.</p>

<p>Under government guidelines, the council isn’t allowed to use enforcement as a way of making money.</p>

39151,"<p>Following notification yesterday from GMB union representatives that their Cityclean members have overwhelming voted in favour of industrial action, Leader of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Councillor Nancy Platts has today said&nbsp;that the talks happening later this week can reset the relationship between the two organisations and prevent strikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nancy said: “For the council to deliver the best services for our residents, businesses and visitors, working closely with trades unions is crucial and is always our aim.</p>

<p>“We know there are problems in our relationship with GMB and we’re determined to resolve this through a series of meeting with the arbitration service ACAS. The first meeting takes place this Thursday with two further meetings in everyone’s diaries to ensure this happens.</p>

39926,"<p>The council has pledged to become a pesticide-free city within three years by halting its use of glyphosate.</p>

<p>A three year plan is being developed to end the use of the toxic weed killer in all the city’s parks, open spaces, pavements, verges and housing land.</p>

<p>Glyphosate, commonly known by its original trade name Roundup, is a toxic herbicide and the world's most widely sold weed killer.</p>

<h2>The harmful effects of glyphosate&nbsp;</h2>

<p>But many experts, including <a href=""https://www.pan-uk.org/"">Pesticide Action Network</a> and the <a href=""https://www.soilassociation.org/our-campaigns/not-in-our-bread/the-pesticide-problem/"">Soil Association</a>, believe it causes cancer in humans while destroying the environment and wildlife.</p>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, the new chair of the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) committee, said: “Following advice from the Pesticide Action Network, officers are developing a three year plan with a view to moving towards ending the use of pesticides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have already started to reduce the amounts of glyphosate used in city parks, housing land and public highways. However, we believe we can accelerate the reduction in use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’m aware of the cross-party support and growing strength of feeling that residents would like the city to be pesticide free.”</p>

<h2>City parks will&nbsp;be pesticide-free&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A report will go to the next ETS committee in October, during which time no glyphosate will be used in the city’s parks while the impact is monitored and alternative solutions are trialled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the public highway and housing land weed spraying will be reduced from 2 per year to one spray this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Pissaridou, who has been the key driver in making a ban happen, added: “We will be limiting the use of glyphosate to lower footfall areas only and using other new technologies including hot foam, infra-red technology and other solutions to ensure only the minimum amount of pesticide required is used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This new technology promises to achieve up to an 80 per cent reduction in the amount of glyphosate used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Overall, we should achieve in excess of 95 per cent reduction in the use of glyphosate by the council this year as compared to last year.</p>

<p>“In future years we will be aiming to eliminate the use of glyphosate by the council and working with partners and residents to replicate this across the city.”</p>

40071,"<p>The city’s busy seafront could soon have 300 new&nbsp;bins in a bid to increase recycling rates and prevent plastics from ending up in the sea.</p>

<p>The bins will have three separate sections in different colours, with two that reflect the city’s seafront heritage - Brighton Borough blue for plastic bottles and cans and Hove Borough maroon for glass. The third section will be black for ordinary rubbish.</p>

<p>The 300 bins will be spread out across the 8 miles (13 kms) seafront from Saltdean to Hove Lagoon, with the greater concentration being in the busiest areas.</p>

<h2>No reason for leaving rubbish on the beach</h2>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, chair of the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) committee, said: “This is fantastic news for everyone who uses the seafront every year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We want to make it easier for people to recycle, and the new bins will do this.</p>

<p>“There will be no reason for anyone to leave their plastic bottles, empty cans, glass or rubbish on the beach or next to a bin that may be full.</p>

<p>“If people find a bin that is full, there will be another very close by they will be able to use.”</p>

<h2>Bins will reflect the city's heritage&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>

<p>The new bins will replace the present street waste bins and fit in more with the seafront’s heritage architecture and tradition. There is already a trial bin on the seafront next to the rebuilt Shelter Hall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some large communal bins will be left to ensure there is proper capacity to cope with high volumes of&nbsp;rubbish during the busy summer months.</p>

<p>The bins being removed will be reused elsewhere and will only be thrown away if broken and no longer useable.</p>

<p>Although the bins can take plastic bottles, empty cans, glass or rubbish, they should not be used for BBQ materials as these can create a fire hazard.</p>

<p>There are though special BBQ bins along the seafront near the sections of the beach where BBQ-ing&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed.</p>

<h2>Plastic liners will not be used&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Cllr Pissaridou added: “The different sections of the bin will not have plastic bin liners inside which will reduce the council’s plastics use and costs, and will be emptied straight into the small dust cart.</p>

<p>“This will reduce the city's plastic consumption and costs.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worthing uses these type of bins which have proved to be weather-proof and have lasted 20 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is expected that the bins will be delivered in batches of 25, with the first ones being placed along the central beach area, with the rest being rolled out soon after.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the bins prove successful, they may be used throughout the city, including parks and open spaces.</p>

40161,"<p>A staggering 30,000 plastic bottle tops have been collected from the city’s beach and seafront in just eight months.</p>

<p>Stacked together, the tops would reach 449 metres, soaring to two and a half times the size of the i360 and rising more than 100 metres above The Shard, London’s highest skyscraper.</p>

<p>Thankfully the tops, from milk, water, coke, fanta and many more types of plastic bottles, have been saved from possibly entering the sea and used to create a beautiful ‘wave’ art installation beside the Volks Railway.</p>

<h2>Cityclean and businesses helped collect the tops</h2>

<p>Irene Soler, a Brighton designer and artist, worked with the council’s Cityclean team and local businesses to gather the bottles tops while local volunteers helped string them together.</p>

<p>Irene said: “I chose bottle tops for the project because they were something I was finding almost every time I walked on the shore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“They are small enough to be swallowed whole by many sea creatures, may be slow to degrade, may float for a long time, and are among the top 5 items found on beaches around the world.</p>

<p>“Besides being easy to store and count, I felt the tops’ bright colours would make an eye-catching design that I hoped would raise awareness about leaving plastics and other rubbish on our beaches and the impact this has on our oceans.”</p>

<h2>Stacked together the bottle tops reach higher than the i360</h2>

<p>Once the project was finished, Irene calculated that if every single bottle top was stacked on top of each other, the plastic column would be 2.5 times the height of the i360 at 162m, more than 3 times the height of the London Eye at 135m and 100m higher than The Shard at 310m.</p>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, chair of the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability committee said: “People would rightly be shocked and horrified if someone pushed a column of plastic bottles tops two and a half times the height of the i360 onto the beach and into the sea.</p>

<p>“But every time someone leaves a bottle top on the beach or seafront they are adding to that massive column and endangering our sea life.</p>

<p>“I’d like to congratulate Irene and everyone involved in creating the art and for bringing this problem to the attention of the public in such an imaginative way.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>150 volunteers helped create the 50 metre 'wave'</h2>

<p>The project, named&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.adropintheocean.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"">A Drop in the Ocean</a>, ran from March to November last year and consisted of three three-month phases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of each phase, the bottle tops collected were counted, sorted and, with the help of more than 150 local volunteers, used to create the 50 metre long wave on the fence beside the world famous railway.</p>

<p>Irene, who lives in Kemp Town, has suggested ways of reducing what’s left after a visit to the beach:&nbsp;</p>

40311,"<p>The council has expressed its ‘disappointment’ that the GMB union, whose members make up the city’s waste and recycling service Cityclean, has called for strike action on a number of dates in August, including the busy Pride weekend.</p>

<p>Council leaders say they are still ‘fully committed’ to resolving outstanding issues with the union, and hope to avert any industrial action taking place.</p>

<p>Talks between the council, union and arbitration service ACAS are taking place this Thursday to see if the situation can be resolved.</p>

<h2>Contingency plans being drawn up</h2>

<p>Meetings are also taking place within the council to develop contingency plans to keep the city clean and tidy if industrial action goes ahead.</p>

<p>The council has also been in contact with the organisers of Pride to ensure they are kept fully up to speed with the developing situation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A council spokesperson said: “We’re very disappointed that the GMB has decided to issue dates for industrial action in two weeks’ time and running through August, including Pride weekend.</p>

<h2>Council fully committed to resolving any issues</h2>

<p>“We’re still fully committed to resolving any outstanding issues through the ACAS talks to ensure the service we provide for our residents and businesses is maintained and not disrupted.</p>

<p>“During talks between the council, the GMB and ACAS there has been clear agreement on most of the issues that the union has concerns about, and another round of talks are due to take place this Thursday.”</p>

<p>The spokesperson added: “We take seriously the allegations of anti-trade union behaviour and are investigating this. We’re also very disappointed that trust between the council and GMB has broken down, but we’re confident this trust can be rebuilt to the benefit of the service.</p>

<h2>Important that all allegations are investigated</h2>

<p>“The council has received a number of allegations and counter allegations which need to be investigated and we’ve agreed with the GMB to appoint an independent person from outside of the council to review this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The council has clear standards of behaviour to ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect at work, and it is important that when there are allegations these are investigated appropriately and fairly through our procedures.</p>

<p>“The staff member involved can continue to undertake their role, but at different site to allow a fair investigation to take place. There is no loss of GMB representation for GMB members at the depot and union members have full choice about who represents them.</p>

<p>“We would therefore hope the union still meets on Thursday with ourselves and ACAS and seek to resolve the issue and avoid industrial action.”<br />

40491,"<p>A Victorian cattle tunnel in Portslade has being given ‘moo-kover’ – thanks to a group of hardworking volunteers and a national cleaning company!</p>

<p>Armed with buckets, brushes and cleaning fluid, around 30 volunteers from the Friends of Vale Park scrubbed the walls of the tunnel which had become a ‘no go’ area for locals, ready for street artist HarpoArt to create a stunning mural – complete with Highland cattle.</p>

<p><img alt="""" data-entity-type="""" data-entity-uuid="""" height=""2133"" src=""/sites/default/files/2TF21724_2019072713033656.jpg"" width=""3200"" /></p>

<p>The rejuvenation project began with a grant from Cif’s Hello Beautiful Neighbourhood Project, which aims to&nbsp;restore&nbsp;the beauty of neighbourhoods and&nbsp;improve people’s happiness. The project was facilitated by Semble.org, a UK-based platform which links community groups together with businesses and volunteers to create change, and the&nbsp;grant was received in June.</p>

<p>Patricia Sauer, chair of the Friends of Vale Park explained: “The Victorian cattle tunnel under the railway line, just west of Portslade station, was on our radar as it’s an important route between the north side and the area around the park and Boundary Road shops. But the tunnel was dirty, graffitied and ill lit and many people had stopped using it.""</p>

<p>She added that the main problem was that a fire had been set inside it last year leaving black soot everywhere.</p>

<h2>Transformation</h2>

<p>“We&nbsp;applied to Cif for a grant and were delighted when the project was granted to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We worked in collaboration with Cif and HarpoArt to totally transform the tunnel and restore it to its original beauty, and somewhere to be used and enjoyed by the local community.”</p>

<p>The volunteers spent around three hours cleaning the tunnel, supported&nbsp;by the council's Cityclean team. “It was inspirational,” said Patricia.&nbsp;“The volunteers, ranging from children to older residents donned protective wear and scrubbed and scrubbed. Many told stories told of walking to school under the tunnel years ago. One lady had been unwell last year and felt proud to be on her feet doing this.”</p>

The event was attended by Deputy Mayor and Portslade Councillor Alan Robins, Cif representatives Bridget McBride and Lucy Donovan, &nbsp;Nick Gardner, Semble and members of The Friends of Vale Park.</p>

<p>Cllr Robins, who worked with local supplier Brewers which donated the paint, said:&nbsp;“This has been a real community effort with residents of all ages rolling up their sleeves, getting stuck in and making a real difference. Thanks to Cif, we have succeeded in transforming the former no-go area into a bright and attractive cut through for local people.”</p>

40586,"<p>Over the Pride weekend, the council’s Cityclean staff worked around the clock dealing with rubbish and recycling.</p>

<h2>Pride goers and day trippers</h2>

<p>Pride is the busiest weekend of the year for the council’s refuse, recycling and street cleaning staff due to a combination of visitors arriving to celebrate Pride and the seasonal rise in day trippers during the school summer holidays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huge crowds were seen across the city, with many staying late into the night making the clean-up operation massive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Use the bins or take it home</h2>

<p>Residents and visitors are always asked to use bins provided or take rubbish and recycling away if the bins are full. It’s not possible to empty bins in crowded areas.</p>

<p>If people dump items on the street, it can take time to deal with. The teams also needed people to disperse before some areas could be cleaned as litter picking between densely crowded people doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Staff were employed to work shifts day and night over the weekend, with the first shift starting at 5am on Saturday and the last shift ending at around 6am on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Staff worked through the night on Saturday to clean the area around Preston Park and St James's Street. Cityclean clear most of the city during the Pride weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Partnership with Pride</h2>

<p>Pride takes responsibility and pays for cleaning up in their official event areas in Preston Park, the Old Steine, St James’s Street and also behind the Community Parade that marches from Hove Lawns to Preston Park.</p>

<p>This year Pride provided more resource than ever before, including bringing in additional litter pickers, extra bins, extending the reach of their cleaning areas and organising a Sunday morning beach clean event in the city centre on Sunday morning. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Major clean up</h2>

<p>Additional rubbish bins were installed in various locations around the city and collected early on Monday morning.</p>

<p>About 67 metric tonnes was collected during this time, that’s the equivalent of almost seven fully compacted refuse lorries of rubbish or around 67,000 full binbags. It’s comparable to the&nbsp;amount of rubbish that the council normally collects in one day from across the entire city.</p>

<p>Five large scarab sweeping machines were used to support the clean by our street cleaners up throughout the weekend.</p>

<p>The Pride clean-up operation will finish tomorrow (Tuesday 6 August) with jet washing of streets and pavements at St James's Street.</p>

<h2>Pride anniversary to be proud of</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “This year’s Pride was the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots and was a chance to look back at the achievements hard won and the rights still to fight for.</p>

<p>""The event rightly drew large numbers of people to the city for the occasion to mingle with the holiday day trippers enjoying a day by the sea and all that Brighton &amp; Hove has to offer.</p>

<p>“Our street cleaners and all our partners do a tremendous job to keep the city clean during the busiest weekend of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p><strong>What was done to ensure the city is kept as clean as possible over Pride weekend?</strong><br />
During the Pride weekend we put additional bins on the seafront as well as along the way along the Pride Parade route. The bins were then left until Monday morning to ensure bigger capacity for litter across the city.</p>

<p><strong>How many staff were there in total over the weekend?</strong><br />
There were 40 extra staff and around 200 staff in total.</p>

<p>We employ more staff to help in the clean up after the parade and also after the increase in the footfall. During the Pride weekend we work 24/7. The operations started on Saturday at 5am and continued until Monday 6am.</p>

<p><strong>Were the Environmental Enforcement Officers&nbsp;working?&nbsp;</strong><br />
The officers were out and about on St James’s Street on Saturday working with businesses to educate about waste removal and handing out pocket ashtrays to people attending Pride events.&nbsp;</p>

40696,"<p>The council has carried out an investigation after some waste collected from the beach during Pride was not recycled.</p>

<p>A mix-up by some Cityclean staff, the council’s waste and recycling service, at the Hollingdean depot led to a number of bags containing tin cans being taken to the energy recovery facility in Newhaven rather than being recycled.</p>

<p>The cans had been collected on the beach by various volunteer groups throughout the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was initially thought all the recycling from the beach - including glass, paper and recyclable plastics - had been taken to the energy recovery facility, but the investigation shows it was tin cans only.</p>

<h2>‘It should never have happened’</h2>

<p>Rachel Chasseaud, assistant director for City Environment, said: “We launched an immediate investigation into what went wrong. We can only hold our hands up and say this was a human error which should never have happened.</p>

<p>“We apologise to every person who volunteered their valuable time to collect the cans from the beach. These hard-working people did the right thing, unfortunately we didn’t.”</p>

<h2>67 tonnes of waste disposed of correctly</h2>

<p>Cityclean collected a total of 67 tonnes of waste – both recycling and rubbish – over the Pride Weekend that was all disposed of correctly.</p>

<p>Normally any materials to be recycled are taken to the Veolia recycling facility at Hollingdean, next door to the Cityclean depot, where they are sorted into different loads for plastics; glass; paper and cardboard; cans, tins, metal jar lids and aerosols.</p>

<p>The vast majority or non-recyclable waste is taken to the energy recovery facility and incinerated to create energy which powers 25,000 Sussex homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very small amount, which cannot be recycled or incinerated like mattresses, is taken to landfill.</p>

<h2>‘This must not happen again’</h2>

<p>Rachel added: “Our investigation found that tin cans collected on the beach by volunteers ended up at the energy recovery facility.</p>

<p>“There is no excuse for something like this happening, but it has taught us a very valuable lesson to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”<br />

40716,"<p>The council has begun an extensive weed removal programme after pledging to become a pesticide-free city.</p>

<p>A team of eight will join existing staff who are already touring the city to remove weeds by hand and with tools as the council reduces the use of toxic herbicide Glyphosate and explores new weed control technology.</p>

<p>The council has been aware of the amount of weeds in the city, but has waited until the growth has developed before taking steps.</p>

<p>The team has already cleared the Bristol Estate, Brighton, of weeds and well as deep cleaning the pavements, and have moved onto other areas in the city.</p>

<h2>A major step forward to becoming pesticide-free</h2>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, chair of the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) committee, said: “Stopping the use of glyphosate is a major step forward in making sure the city, its residents, wildlife and environment are all pesticide-free.</p>

<p>“It will always be the case that stopping the use of pesticides will mean more weeds, but this new team will control growth in the short-term while we investigate the use of new technologies including hot foam and infra-red technology.”</p>

<h2>Council taking expert advice</h2>

<p>The council is working closely with the Brighton-based Pesticide Action Network, &nbsp;experts in how to become pesticide-free.</p>

<p>A plan is being developed to end the use of the toxic weed killer in all the city’s parks, open spaces, pavements, verges and housing land within three years.</p>

<p>Cllr Pissaridou added: “We have already started to reduce the amounts of glyphosate used in city parks, housing land and public highways. However, we believe we can accelerate the reduction in use.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The harmful effects of glyphosate&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Glyphosate, commonly known by its original trade name Roundup, is a toxic herbicide and the world's most widely sold weed killer.</p>

<p>But many experts, including Pesticide Action Network and the Soil Association, believe it causes cancer in humans while destroying the environment and wildlife.</p>

<p>A report will go to the next ETS committee in October, during which time no glyphosate will be used in the city’s parks while the impact is monitored and alternative solutions are trialled.&nbsp;</p>

40906,"<p>Council leader Nancy Platts is backing a community campaign calling on Highways England to take over responsibility for removing litter on the A27.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sussex residents forming the A27 Clean Up Campaign have written to the Transport Secretary to point out that the current system doesn’t work.</p>

<p>It leaves councils responsible for removing litter while Highways England are responsible for cutting back the vegetation and strimming the grass.</p>

<p>If verges are strimmed before a litter pick, the shredded litter and plastic becomes too small to collect and becomes embedded in the soil.</p>

<p>This affects not only the surrounding wildlife and flora but also the water table and later the sea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also causes blockages to roadside drainage channels and leaves unsightly plastic blowing along the roadsides.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The A27 Clean Up Campaign&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The A27 Clean Up Campaign group formed to highlight the issue and raise awareness of the amount of roadside litter and debris left along the picturesque Sussex route.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The A27 is a national trunk road owned by Highways England. Maintenance of the road is the responsibility of Highways England, as is the cleaning and management of the central reservations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councils receive no funding for clearing verges and have to pay Highways England’s contractors for the necessary road closures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They need to co-ordinate with Highways England’s contractors for litter picks to take place during other maintenance work. This often proves impractical and means many parts of the road are strewn with litter for long periods.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A complicated and expensive task</h2>

<p>Councillor Platts said: “Keeping the verges of the major roads in the city’s area clean is a major job. We collected 500 bags of rubbish during our clean-up of the A27 and A23 in May.</p>

<p>“It’s currently a very complicated and expensive task and I fully support the campaign’s call for Highways England to take over responsibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The A27 runs through seven different local authority areas, and we have to co-ordinate with all of them as well as Highways England over lane closures, staff safety and keeping traffic disruption to a minimum. It would be a much simpler operation for Highways England to undertake.</p>

<p>“Of course, keeping verges clean and litter free is everyone’s responsibility. People should not be throwing rubbish out of their cars. It is irresponsible and anti-social.”</p>

<h2>A more efficient system needed</h2>

<p>Neil Kerridge, co-chair of the A27 Clean Up Campaign, said: “The poor condition of the road has seen a marked deterioration over the last few years with a substantial increase in roadside litter, grit and other debris.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s an eyesore for everyone who travels along it, hence the increasing number of complaints, not only from local residents but also from visitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“While more needs to be done to prevent the litter happening in the first place through education and enforcement, we need to ensure that the system for removing the litter is as efficient and effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Each of the local authorities and MPs with whom we are working recognises that this is a serious issue which needs to be addressed at national level.</p>

<p>“We have therefore written to Grant Shapps MP, the new Secretary of State for Transport, requesting that he uses his powers under&nbsp;the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to transfer responsibility for cleaning the A27 to Highways England.”&nbsp;</p>

41266,"<p>Council leader Nancy Platts sets out her vision for tackling climate change and building the city's resilience.</p>

<h3>Future-proofing the city</h3>

<p>Cities like ours are facing a wide range of challenges, from environmental risks caused by climate change, such as flooding and energy scarcity, to population growth and urbanisation.</p>

<p>While these challenges are global and may not be visible to us right now, they have significant potential to affect our way of life and our future capacity to thrive as a hub of economic and social activity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tackling climate change</h3>

<p>I supported last week’s climate strike because I recognise the strength of feeling amongst residents on the urgent need to tackle climate change. Seeing thousands of people take to the streets sends a very powerful message to governments at all levels and I want everyone to know that we are listening.</p>

<p>As politicians, we have to make choices on behalf of the near 300,000 people who live in our city, as well as everyone who works here and with great consideration to the 11 million people who visit each year, contributing enormously to our local economy. We make decisions knowing that they will have a far-reaching and long lasting effect.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Building the city's resilience</h3>

<p>We can’t know for sure what will be happening in fifty or even twenty years’ time but we can take action now to build our city’s resilience to the global pressures that affect us all at a local level, while ensuring that we can continue to adapt and grow.</p>

<p>Being creative in our planning and ambitious in our visions for the future will reverberate globally. Emissions per person in the city are some of the lowest of towns and cities in the UK and that puts us in a powerful position to not only react to what is happening but to also become drivers of change.</p>

<h3>Reducing transport emissions</h3>

<p>Earlier this year, the council declared a climate emergency and committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. We know that if we are to meet this target, we have to significantly reduce transport emissions.</p>

<p>Government statistics published last week showed that Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions from road transport have continued to grow since 1990 and the reason for this is traffic. The more vehicles on the roads, the more traffic there is, which leads to lots of idling engines, emitting the toxic fumes that contribute to air pollution.</p>

<h3>Investing in infrastructure</h3>

<p>While this is a national issue, it is one that we have the power to influence locally. Projects like Valley Gardens are essential because they provide the necessary infrastructure to make it possible for more people to make their journeys using public transport, cycling or walking.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove is proudly one of the least car-dependent cities in the UK, but we have to go further if we are to make progress fast.<br />
We have already taken a number of positive steps including introducing an Ultra Low Emission Zone for buses, supporting transport operators to switch to greener technology and delivering Electric Vehicle infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Improving cycling and walking routes</h3>

<p>Over the coming months we’ll be developing a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan, to improve the walking and cycling network right across the city and enhance links to neighbouring areas, including the South Downs National Park.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Leading the way on sustainable transport</h3>

<p>Our overall strategy for the next few years will be set out in the city’s new Local Sustainable Transport Plan, which will aim to make Brighton &amp; Hove one of the best places in the country for walking, cycling and public transport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plans that we are implementing now are with a city in mind that over the coming years will transform for the better; where dependence on cars will decrease and use of zero emission transport will increase and where green spaces with more trees and plants will support greater biodiversity, improving air quality and providing a better environment for us all.</p>

As part of our consultation and stakeholder engagement we are taking on board feedback provided to us and using it to develop the proposed design of the scheme.</p>

<p>Here Councillor Gill Mitchell sets out our vision for Valley Gardens.</p>

<h2>A new central park</h2>

<p>Valley Gardens is the name given to the green spaces that run from St Peter’s Church to the seafront. It is one of Brighton &amp; Hove’s overlooked gems, home to a National Elm Collection of international significance and a conservation area which forms an important part of the city’s heritage.</p>

<p>However, over time, this oasis of green has become a series of inaccessible traffic islands with busy roads on both sides cutting the area off from the communities around it. Rather than adding to the city’s renowned cultural and tourism offer, the current environment provides a poor first impression of people’s enjoyment of this part of the city centre, including those visitors arriving in the city at Brighton Station just a short walk away.</p>

<p>Our vision for Valley Gardens is to enhance the area’s green spaces and create new public spaces for people to spend time in, which will be linked together to create a single continuous public park. Simplifying the surrounding road layout and creating dedicated and connected walking and cycling routes will make travelling around the area safe and accessible for residents, commuters and visitors, in the most sustainable way.</p>

<h2>Making the area safer</h2>

<p>Work is currently underway on the first two phases of the project, from St Peter’s Church to Edward Street, and is on track to be completed in two years.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the Valley Gardens scheme, which focuses on the Old Steine to Palace Pier area is a continuation of Phases 1 &amp; 2 and vital to achieving a coordinated and well planned set of fresh, new gardens, paths and road links down to the sea.</p>

<p>Making the area safer for all transport users is a key objective; the existing area has the highest number of collisions in the city and conditions for cycling are particularly dangerous on the seafront.</p>

<p>The scheme will help address this by introducing a traffic signal T junction at the Palace Pier and create a significant missing link in the city centre’s cycling network and much improved and more direct crossings for walking. New ‘intelligent’ traffic signals will coordinate and balance traffic flows with pedestrian and cycling movements in a far better way than at present.</p>

<h2>Improved access to sustainable travel&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We are already one of the country’s least car-dependent cities outside London. More than a third of the city’s residents do not own a car and nearly twice as many people walk to work compared with the rest of the UK. We also have one of the most efficient and well used bus networks outside of the capital, connecting local people from around the city and enabling quick, short travel.</p>

<p>We are therefore developing the city’s public transport network with a future in mind in which reliance on cars for short journeys is reduced, air quality is improved and access to sustainable travel is made easier for everyone. Nowhere is this more important than in the centre of our beautiful city.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Consultation and engagement</h2>

<p>To get this far, Phase 3 of the project has been through the council’s robust democratic process, which requires a majority vote to be passed at a committee to enable major capital projects like this one to advance to the next stage of development. Approval by the Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) Committee has been sought at each stage of this project, effectively giving council officers additional delegated authority to conduct further work.</p>

<p>Last summer we consulted people on their impressions of the area, how they used it and what they would like to see improved. Over 800 people gave us their views and we used their comments to develop the eight core principles on which to base the new designs. Forty four design options were whittled down to four and then down to the preferred option – Option 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Option 1 was determined as the one which best meets the aims and objectives of the scheme overall and was therefore approved for public consultation. A six week public consultation which began in October 2018 and was widely publicised, gathered feedback from residents and stakeholders on this option and this has directly influenced the further development of the scheme which will be reported to ETS committee when it meets on 7 February.</p>

<h2>Securing funding&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The estimated cost of the project is £7.84 million, the majority of which (£6 million) will come from a central government pot of money called the Local Growth Fund (LGF) and is money that is set aside for projects that benefit the local area and economy, including transport. This money cannot be spent on any other council services or projects.</p>

<p>The Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), which approved the £6 million allocation, requires the local authority to contribute funding for the project of at least 15% of the project cost. This means that the remainder of the funding for the project, currently estimated at £1.84 million, will come from the council’s Local Transport Plan budget, local contributions and potentially private sector development contributions. The LEP also requires that we spend the project funding by a certain deadline, which in this case is March 2021.</p>

<p>Securing funding from the LEP and seeking approval from ETS committee on 7 February marks an important point in the project’s programme, which will again be followed by another round of public consultation.</p>

<h2>Emphasising the area's historic character</h2>

<p>On completion, the whole of the Valley Gardens will become a more attractive, accessible and usable city centre space which will emphasise the area’s historic and cultural character, and enhance key tourist attractions including the Royal Pavilion and Palace Pier.</p>

<p>Reconnecting the green spaces to the surrounding network of unique shopping streets, hotels and places to eat and relax will ensure that it’s potential as a public open space is fully realised and make Valley Gardens a destination in its own right.</p>

33731,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove continues to have the highest rate of bus use outside London with 49.2 million passenger journeys made in 2017/18, up from 45.6 million in 2015/16 and a significant rise from the 40.8 million passenger journeys made in 2009/10. Twice as many passenger journeys are being made now than in&nbsp;1993.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working in partnership</h2>

<p>The continued popularity of the bus in the city can be explained by the council’s award-winning Quality Bus Partnership with the bus operators, which creates the conditions for frequent, effective services run with modern vehicles and the latest information technology.</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council works with Brighton &amp; Hove Buses, The Big Lemon and Compass Travel to support zero and low emission bus services across the city. We plan and fund&nbsp;a number of bus services including some complete routes and a number of weekend and school services. &nbsp;As these services are not profitable, they would not run without council funding. The council’s overall budget for supporting bus services is £1,041,900 per year.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sustainable travel</h2>

<p>All of the city’s buses are fitted with the latest Euro 6 low emission engines which meet clean air requirements. The Big Lemon buses are now solar powered, having previously run on waste cooking oil. It is expected that their electric bus fleet will be up and running in the near future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supporting sustainable bus travel is parts of the council’s wider strategy to improve air quality in the city, which has included securing government funding to fit 76 buses and 22 taxis with clean air technology, introducing a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and establishing an Air Quality Programme Board. This year, 200 electric vehicle charging points will be installed across the city thanks to a successful bid by the council for £300,000 of government funding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell, said: “We are committed to supporting low emission, sustainable travel to help improve air quality in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have the highest rate of bus use of any local authority outside of London so it is vital that we do everything we can to improve the efficiency and reduce the emissions of the city’s buses.</p>

<p>“A lot of work has been done with the local bus companies to ensure we are joined up in our approach and we look forward to continuing our work with them to see what more can be done.”&nbsp;</p>

33766,"<p>Revisions&nbsp;have been made to the design option for&nbsp;the scheme to&nbsp;take into account the feedback submitted&nbsp;by residents and stakeholders during the latest public consultation.</p>

<p>An initial scoping consultation in Summer 2018 gathered the views of local residents, businesses and users as to how the area is used, what issues there are in travelling around the &nbsp;current area and priorities for improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second stage of public consultation&nbsp;ran for six weeks&nbsp;from 15 October to 25 November 2018 providing residents and stakeholders the opportunity to have their say on the proposed design option for the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were 828 responses to the consultation which overall were favourable and indicated clear support for the majority of the proposals included in the design. Feedback provided was taken into account and considered in relation to the projects core design objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revised proposals include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The creation of a dedicated southbound priority lane for buses, taxis and coaches</li>
	<li>Improved junction alignments to provide direct, convenient connections and more space for pedestrians and cyclists on the seafront promenade</li>
	<li>Improved north-south connections for cyclists and the realignment &nbsp;of the new north-south cycle lane</li>
	<li>Footpaths to create more direct links with North Street, The Lanes, St James’s Street and the Seafront across the Steine Gardens&nbsp;</li>
	<li>More parking bays for blue badge holders, doctors parking bays and loading bays &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Officers will now&nbsp;proceed to the detailed design stage, with further public consultation due to take place as plans develop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell, said: “There has been extensive public information and consultation to date on the Valley Gardens Phase 3 project. We have taken on board the feedback provided and this has been used to develop the option further. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is a significant opportunity to revitalise the Old Steine to Palace Pier area by improving the transport and public realm infrastructure. The aim is to make cycling, walking and public transport more attractive and viable options of transport, as well as improving the landscape to create an attractive, sustainable and safe green space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Making the area safer for all transport users is a key objective; the existing area has the highest number of collisions in the city and conditions for cycling are particularly dangerous on the seafront. The area is also one of the main arrival points into the city and the redesign will enhance the quality of the environment to reflect the city’s status as a key visitor destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are very pleased to have been successful in our bid for £6 million of funding for the scheme from the Local Enterprise Partnership. Officers will now be able to proceed to the detailed design stage and work towards delivering the scheme by 2021.”</p>

<p>Our&nbsp;bid was awarded in full and will pay for 75% of the scheme to provide a network of charging facilities for taxis across the city. The remaining 25% will be paid for through a concession agreement, with a portion of the charge coming back to the council.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What we will do</strong></h2>

<p>Taxis will benefit from four rapid charging electric vehicle hubs in the city. Each hub will have three rapid charging stations and will be for taxi use. The infrastructure is designed to support taxi operators in choosing electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Councillor Gill Mitchell, chair of the city’s environment, transport &amp; sustainability committee, said: “This money will support local companies who want to introduce electric vehicles to their fleet by ensuring they have the infrastructure to operate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s part of our aim, in partnership not only with taxi drivers, but also with public transport operators, businesses, residents and visitors to support and encourage the move &nbsp;towards zero emissions and improved air quality for all who live, work and visit the city.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Taxi survey</strong></h2>

<p>Our licensing team have played an important part in talking to the taxi trade and worked with transport officers on the bid.</p>

<p>In a council survey of taxi and private hire drivers and companies, 81% of those responding said that their cars currently use diesel but almost a third said they would consider changing to an electric vehicle in the next one to two years and 43% said they had seen an electric vehicle they would like to buy but would not do so until there were more places to charge. The cost of charging an electric vehicle would be much cheaper than conventional fuel.</p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent said that dedicated taxi charging points were ‘essential’ and almost half (47%) said they would be likely to charge their vehicle at a public car park with shops or a café which fits in with our strategy to install rapid charging hubs with nearby facilities. Almost 92% said they were likely to charge their vehicles at home off shift, meaning they would start the day with a full charge, so providing a rapid charge facility mid shift would be an ideal solution for them.</p>
","Following our latest bid success for electric vehicle infrastructure, we'll be able to install four rapid charging electric vehicle hubs for taxis.","Transport and roads"
35036,"<p>Many schools in the city often experience illegal,&nbsp;dangerous driving and parking near their gates. This creates a congested and unpleasant environment, increasing levels of air pollution and at times making it unsafe for families to cross roads.</p>

<h2>How you can help</h2>

<p>By reducing car trips, the school journey can provide an opportunity for the whole family to be more active. Those who have to drive&nbsp;can still help greatly by making sure they&nbsp;park or drop off away from the school gate, in a legal, safe and considerate way.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>The council is responsible for the enforcement of on-street parking restrictions. Civil Enforcement Officers (CEOs) patrol areas where illegal and dangerous parking is a potential threat to child safety. Penalty Charge Notices (parking tickets) can be issued by CEOs and Fixed Penalty Notices by the police if a vehicle is parked illegally.</p>

<p>The police have a duty to enforce other traffic offences, which can result in penalty points being issued on your driving licence. These include dangerous parking, causing obstruction and parking on pedestrian crossings, including the area marked by the zig-zag lines.</p>

<h3>Examples of parking contraventions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Parking in residents or disabled parking bays unless you are entitled to do so and can display a valid badge</li>
	<li>Waiting or parking on School Keep Clear zig-zag lines and controlled pedestrian crossings</li>
	<li>Waiting or parking on single yellow lines during their times of operation, double yellow lines at any time and on pavements unless signs permit</li>
	<li>Failing to pay and display a valid parking ticket where there is a parking charge</li>
	<li>Stopping or parking in taxi ranks or on cycle lanes during their period of operation</li>
	<li>Double parking obstructing pedestrian or vehicle access points where there are dropped kerbs</li>
	<li>Stopping on a bus stop</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Councillor Gill Mitchell, Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee said: “It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure safety outside schools. We’re urging parents and carers to consider alternative ways of travelling to school and reduce the number of journeys made by car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>""This will help improve safety outside schools, reduce congestion in the surrounding area and encourage children to be more active.”&nbsp;</p>
","Parents and carers are being urged to reduce the number of journeys made by car to help improve safety and air quality outside the city's schools.","Transport and roads"
35041,"<p>Over the last few months we’ve been talking to residents and businesses in the Elm Grove, Hanover and St Luke’s areas about how their parking schemes are working and whether they would like to change the hours and / or days of operation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Gill Mitchell, chair of the Environment, Transport &amp; Sustainability Committee, said: “This consultation and review gave residents the opportunity to tell us about whether they were satisfied with the schemes and any issues, and whether they would like more or reduced enforced hours and/or days.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“As a result we are putting forward some changes which will be decided at the next committee on 19 March.”</p>

<p>The Environment, Transport &amp; Sustainability Committee is at Hove Town Hall from 4pm and is open to the public. Read the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=823&amp;MId=8105"">Parking Schemes Update Report (agenda item number 78).</a></p>

<h1>St Luke’s area (Zone U)</h1>

<p>We consulted residents to find out if they wished to change the operating hours of their parking scheme.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The St Luke’s Area residents’ parking scheme currently operates between 10-11am and 2-3pm seven days a week. Because it is only enforceable for a couple of hours a day it is known as a ‘light touch’ scheme.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Just over 70% of those who responded supported joining the neighbouring Queens Park zone (Zone C) which currently operates 9am to 8pm seven days a week.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillors will decide whether to change Zone U into Zone C on 19 March. If agreed, the change would come into effect on 1 June 2019.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Hanover &amp; Elm Grove (Zone S &amp;&nbsp;V)</h1>

<p>At the end of last year we carried out a review of the two parking zones in the Hanover &amp; Elm Grove area which have been operating for more than a year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Following the committee, we’ll be writing to residents to update them on the outcome of the review.</p>

<h2>Zone S</h2>

<p>The Zone S ‘light touch’ scheme operates Monday to Friday 11am-midday and 6-7pm. A quarter of residents in the area responded to the consultation, with just over 60% in support of keeping the scheme hours as they are.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Some residents in a small number of streets known as the ‘top triangle’ supported further consultation to find out whether they would like to join the Zone V scheme.</p>

<p>The top triangle area includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arnold Street</li>
	<li>Baxter Street</li>
	<li>Carlyle Street</li>
	<li>Cromwell Street</li>
	<li>Lynton Street</li>
	<li>Part of Queens Park Road</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some residents commented about speeding on one-way streets, and there will be an opportunity to outline these issues in more detail if detailed consultation is given the go ahead.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Another problem raised was about pavement parking on Elm Grove. Along with other councils we are lobbying the government for pavement parking powers similar to those in London.</p>

<h3>Freshfield Street and Queen’s Park Rise</h3>

<p>If the decision is to join the St Luke’s parking scheme (Zone U, see above) with the Queen’s Park area (Zone C), Freshfield Street and Queens Park Rise, currently in the ‘light touch’ Zone S will be surrounded by roads with parking enforcement 9am to 8pm.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The proposal is to ask residents in these two roads whether they too wish to join the Queen Park Scheme (Zone C) or remain in Zone S.</p>

<h1>Zone V</h1>

<p>The Zone V residents’ parking scheme operates seven days a week from 9am to 8pm.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Most of those who responded to the consultation (80%) supported keeping the hours as they are and 70% said they were satisfied with the scheme.&nbsp;</p>
","An update on parking consultations with residents in the Elm Grove, Hanover and St Luke's areas of the city will be discussed by councillors. As a result of what residents told us we are proposing some changes.","Transport and roads"
35146,"<p>The Environment, Transport and Sustainability (ETS) committee has approved a report setting out the Local Transport Plan (LTP) capital budget for the next financial year and recommends that it is agreed by Policy, Resources and Growth Committee on 21 March. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The budget allocation</h2>

<p>The LTP proposed programme budget allocation for 2019/20 is £6.798 million of capital investment which has been allocated by the government and is focused on maintaining and renewing the road network to a high standard and improving safety. It also includes proposals to increase journey choices by providing for and encouraging the use of sustainable transport; and creating a more attractive public realm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The amount of funding is based on government estimates of how much investment is required in the city. This is also supplemented by other council funding and other sources such as the Local Growth Fund, which is received from the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of capital funding for approved and new transport schemes and projects for 2019/20 was agreed at full council on 28 February 2019 as part of the overall budget. The one year delivery plan outlined in the committee report explains how the council plans to develop, manage and deliver transport over the next year.</p>

<h2>Getting the basics right</h2>

<p>The proposed programme allocates funding across a number of areas including maintenance and repairs, asset management and integrated transport projects and programmes. It includes commitments to schemes that are already approved and ongoing programmes of works, as well as new projects which will deliver long-term benefits to the city and its residents.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Major projects</h2>

<p>Schemes include those within the city centre, such as Valley Gardens and the seafront, including rebuilding and regenerating the historic Victorian ‘arches’, structures which support the promenade and A259. This continues the essential work that began in 2015 to save the seafront road from collapse and reconstruct the former West Street Shelter Hall.</p>

<h2>Investing in sustainable travel&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The funding in 2019/20 has been increased by £1 million for investment in citywide improvements to supplement planned LTP investment in 2019/20. Alongside the development of the Local Cycling &amp; Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP), this investment will contribute to better cycling infrastructure within the city’s cycle network and in turn, will support the commitments made by the council to address the effects of climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell said: “This Local Transport Plan delivery programme includes significant investment in sustainable travel initiatives and major city centre developments which will enhance the public realm. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“As well as supporting ongoing sustainable transport projects, an extra £1 million funding is being made available for investment that will significantly improve the city’s walking and cycling infrastructure. Providing for and encouraging the use of sustainable transport will help reduce congestion in the city centre and improve air quality, as well as giving residents more choice about how they travel around the city.</p>

<p>“This one year delivery plan also ensures we get the basics right, like fixing road surfaces and maintaining, managing and improving the city’s transport and highway infrastructure; all of which helps support and provide access to the many activities that are important to the city’s residents and local communities.”</p>
","The city's Local Transport Plan, which sets out the budget and delivery programme for the year ahead, has been approved by the Environment, Transport and Sustainability committee.  ","Transport and roads"
35186,"<p>We're working with our partners at Love to Ride to promote Ride to Work Week to encourage people across the city to cycle to work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Health benefits&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Cycling has many benefits and people who ride to work are shown to be happier, healthier, wealthier and more productive. Getting more staff cycling to work can benefit employers too, reducing illness and sick leave; with cycle commuters taking half the sick leave of their non-cycling colleagues. Those who ride to work regularly also report improved mental health.</p>

<h2>Saving money&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As well as the health benefits, those who cycle to work don’t need to worry about the cost of commuting. The average UK worker spends £146 per month, or £135,000 over their working life, travelling to and from work. Commuting by bike can save employees money on travel and parking.</p>

<h2>Improving air quality</h2>

<p>Getting more people in the city cycling also helps the local environment by reducing congestion and improving air quality. Congestion and pollution contribute to 40,000 premature deaths annually in the UK and road transport is the main source of emissions in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<h2>Cycle schemes</h2>

<p>Many of the city’s employers, including Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, offer a Cycle to Work Scheme which enables employees to borrow up to £3,000, tax and National Insurance free, to buy a bike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BTN BikeShare scheme, which began in September 2017, has over 500 bikes available for hire from hubs across the city. The pay as you go bike rental costs just 3p per minute, allowing residents and visitors to travel around the city cheaply and sustainably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The council also runs subsidised training and maintenance courses to help residents get back on their bike and feel confident and safer when cycling around the city.</p>

<h2>Investing in the city's cycling infrastructure&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Gill Mitchell, said: “Cycling is increasingly becoming a more popular way of getting from A to B. Our investment in the city’s cycling infrastructure has made it easier for people to do so and we will continue to look at ways to develop this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Transport Plan programme for the year ahead includes investment which will contribute to the development of the city’s cycle network. This includes better surfaces, joined up and marked routes and improvements to the safety and quality of junction crossings for cyclists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is a thriving cycling community in the city and we are delighted to have been able to expand the Bike Share scheme this year with 120 new bikes and more hubs installed in the west of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Numerous studies have proven that cycling makes people happier and healthier, while also enhancing the environment by reducing congestion and air pollution. I hope many residents are inspired to get back on their bike this week and cycle for fun, health and for commuting.”<br />

	<li>emphasised the importance of active travel in multi-modal infrastructure and information</li>
	<li>made recommendations which would help ensure future investment and development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sustainable and active travel&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A successful bid by the council in 2016 resulted in the Department for Transport awarding Brighton &amp; Hove £1.485m for three years until April 2020 under the Access Fund for Sustainable Travel, to undertake sustainable and active travel projects. This followed previous successful bids for the Local Sustainable Transport Fund&nbsp;and the Sustainable Travel Transition Year.</p>

<h2>Partnership work</h2>

<p>The submission highlighted the projects that have been delivered since the awarding of the funding, including the work done with schools and employers, as well as partnership work with transport stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Women in transport&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Principal Transport Planner, Laura Wells, who led on producing the written submission and who works in Transport Policy and Strategy, will attend the committee on 3 April 2019 to give evidence on behalf of the council. Three out of four members of the panel giving evidence in that session are female transport professionals from local authorities in England. The committee recently encouraged more women to take part in committee inquiries to improve representation.</p>

35776,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council has been allocated £440,000 of government funding as a reward for demonstrating best practice in highway repairs and maintenance.</p>

<h2>Demonstrating best practice</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport established the Highways Maintenance Incentive Fund in 2014, to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering value for money in carrying out cost effective improvements in local highway maintenance and delivery.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Meeting the government's criteria</h2>

<p>The system requires that local authorities are placed into three bands, with those in the lowest performing band (Band 1) losing a share of their funding. Performance is measured against the government’s criteria in the following areas:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Asset management</li>
	<li>Resilience</li>
	<li>Customer satisfaction</li>
	<li>Benchmarking &amp; Efficiency&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Operational delivery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Improving performance&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Transport officers have been working to improve Brighton &amp; Hove’s performance in all areas and the council is now in Band 3, having started at Band 1 and risen up progressively via Band 2. This means that the council is now eligible for 100% of its funding allocation.</p>

<p>In 2019/20, only authorities in Band 3 will receive the full share of their funding, whilst authorities in Band 2 will receive 50% of their share and Band 1 will receive 10%.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Investing in the city's roads</h2>

<p>The £440,000 is in addition to the £108,485 of funding the council has been allocated under the government’s Pothole Action Fund. The money will be spent on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>repairing potholes</li>
	<li>improving road surfaces</li>
	<li>ensuring the city’s roads are maintained</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll be&nbsp;reporting on our website exactly how we invest&nbsp;the money, in accordance with government requirements.</p>

35986,"<p>We are freezing most of the parking charges in the city.</p>

<p>From this week there will be <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/parking/parking-fees-and-charges-2019-20-0"">changes to some parking charges </a>to help manage high-demand times and areas, reduce congestion and improve air quality.</p>

<p>Improving air quality is a priority for the city. Nationally, poor air quality is responsible for approximately 50,000 premature deaths every year.</p>

<p>Together with other measures such as the low emissions zone, parking charges help manage traffic away from busy areas, ease congestion that also affects journey times and encourage higher turnover of spaces which supports business.</p>

<h2>Tariff changes</h2>

<p>There will be a small increase of between 10p and 50p for two, four and 11 hour rates in some on-street zones and car parks. Only one increase is higher – with the 9 hour band at London Road car park set to go to £9 (from £8).</p>

<p>A new quarterly season ticket will be introduced for London Road car park to make it easier for regular customers. A quarterly season is already available for Rottingdean Marine Cliffs, High Street and Regency Square.</p>

<p>Resident, visitor, business, trader or hotel permits will not change, nor will those for schools, doctors, professional carers.</p>

<p>Residents can get a 50% discount on a resident permit if they have a low emission vehicle or electric vehicle.</p>

<h2>Transport strategy</h2>

<p>Setting the right level of parking charges is an important part of the city's transport strategy and helps manage limited parking space, address congestion, lower emissions and improve air quality.</p>

<p>We invest any surplus that comes out of these charges back into improving transport for all in the city, from subsidised bus services and road maintenance to bus passes for older people and tackling misuse of disabled parking spaces.</p>

<p>Councillors agreed the fees and charges for 2019-20 at the <a href=""https://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=823&amp;MId=8104&amp;Ver=4"">Environment, Transport &amp; Sustainability Committee on 22 January. </a>The parking charges details are in Appendix 2 of&nbsp;agenda item 56.</p>

<p>We have worked closely with bus operators to ensure that residents across the city have access to key routes on the network and that any disruption is kept to a minimum.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New Big Lemon bus routes</h2>

<p>Changes to The Big Lemon routes 16, 47, 52, 56, 57 and 66 will offer more efficient cross-city services and improvements which aim to attract more passengers and support the sustainability of the bus service into the future. The revised routes will operate initially on a one-year trial basis.</p>

<h2>A new night bus&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There will also be changes to Compass services 37 and 37B, which are council-funded and to Brighton &amp; Hove Buses’ commercial services to include a new night bus route, the N21, which will serve Queen’s Park, Manor Hill, Whitehawk and Bristol Estate.</p>

<h2>Breeze and buses to schools</h2>

<p>The three Breeze bus routes, the 77, 78 and 79, which connect the city to the South Downs and a number of routes serving schools, including the council-funded services the&nbsp;16A, 16B, 72, 74, 75, 76, 76A, 95, 95A and&nbsp;70, 72A and 93, will also be revised.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Improved city centre bus stops&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Changes to the city’s bus stops will mean that some&nbsp;services will have changed&nbsp;locations&nbsp;in the Churchill Square/Clock Tower and North Street areas of the city.</p>

<p>The changes are being introduced to improve the flow of buses and reliability of services. Another benefit will be better grouping of bus routes which serve many of the same destinations. These changes are being implemented by Brighton &amp; Hove Buses, in partnership with other operators and the council. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The changes have been designed to improve the flow of buses, aiding air quality and pedestrian movements in the area and improving journey times for the many thousands of regular bus users.</p>

<h2>Laying the groundwork</h2>

<p>The gardens will then be turned fallow in order to restore the soils nutrient value to sustain the growth for the new planting. Following this, decompaction will take place to help break up the soil, which will improve water flow, aeration, nutrient accessibility and root growth.</p>

<p>Once the soil has been prepared, the profiling for the newly designed footpaths will begin and new planting will then start.</p>

<p>The local voluntary garden group also took a small number of plants to be used in their community garden.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>More trees, shrubs and grasses&nbsp;</h2>

<p>No trees will be removed from the area as a result of the project works, however, an independent tree survey identified a number of trees that could sensibly be removed or relocated during the course of the project. These are generally trees that are planted in locations that inhibit their ability to reach their full potential or are diseased or dying.</p>

36776,"<p>Brighton &amp; Hove City Council has made its first successful prosecution for&nbsp;an unauthorised dropped kerb crossing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case against Jason Bennett and CCE Sussex Limited was heard at Brighton Magistrates Court on 1 May 2019. They faced five charges of making unauthorised dropped kerb crossings in Reading Road, Brighton contrary to the Highways Act 1980.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prosecution came after council officials examined the five crossings and found that they were of sub-standard construction and had been created without the necessary permissions.</p>

<p>Mr Bennett, a former director of CCE Sussex Limited, pleaded guilty to all the charges in his absence relating to the unauthorised highway works. CCE Sussex Limited of Horstead Keynes was also convicted in their absence. They were each ordered to pay a fine of £1000 for each of the five offences, together with £600.00 costs and £100.00 Victim Surcharge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, they were each ordered to pay £4301.52 of compensation to the council to cover the costs of correctly constructing the vehicle crossings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each defendant has 14 days in which to pay a total of £10,001.52 fines, costs and compensation.</p>

37376,"<p>Ten historic seafront lanterns have been removed following inspections found that they had corroded faster than normally expected.</p>

<p>The corrosion was discovered during routine checks which are currently being carried out on all of the 163 iconic lanterns, which run along the promenade from Black Rock to Hove Lagoon.</p>

<p>Eight of the lanterns were on Madeira Drive and two on Marine Parade where the inspection is ongoing.</p>

<h2>Safety is paramount</h2>

<p>Speaking about the extent of the corrosion, David Parker, the council’s head of transport projects &amp; engineering said the safety of the public was paramount.</p>

<p>“We know how much these lights are treasured by our residents and visitors, but our priority has to be the safety of everyone walking underneath them. We always expect to find some corrosion when we carry out our routine inspections, but to have to remove lanterns so early into the inspection programme was not expected by the team.</p>

<h2>Checks continuing</h2>

<p>“Thorough checks are being carried out over the next few weeks and, where needed, we will remove any lantern that we think presents a risk.</p>

<p>“We will be talking to our conservation officers and, if needed, English Heritage to ensure we have lamps that are in-keeping with the traditional look of the original lamps as much as possible, but that will also be longer lasting and easier to manage from a financial aspect.”</p>

<p>Corrosion of the lanterns happens due to the salty air coming off the sea which is something that cannot be avoided. Checks on the seafront lampposts take place every two years.</p>

<p>To report a lantern which you think has suffered from severe corrosion and needs our immediate attention, please use our <a href=""https://selfservice.brighton-hove.gov.uk/AchieveForms/?mode=fill&amp;consentMessage=yes&amp;form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Form-7c401f05-53c6-4d68-a4cd-3e041b3381c1/definition.json"">street lighting reporting online form</a> or call our&nbsp;Street Lighting Team on 07557 197566.</p>

37481,"<p>The Exchanging Places event offers a chance to find out exactly what bus drivers can and can’t see as they drive through the city centre; and demonstrates&nbsp;how wearing&nbsp;high-visibility gear can make a big difference to cyclists. The event is designed to encourage mutual respect on the city’s roads.</p>

<h2>Keeping a safe distance</h2>

<p>A ‘Safe Pass’ mat will be used to illustrate the minimum distance at which cyclists should be passed – 1.5m – and is designed to encourage motorists to give more space when overtaking pedal cyclists.</p>

<p>Virtual reality goggles will be available to illustrate how it feels for cyclists when vehicles pass them too closely – as well as showing the blind spots of large vehicles.</p>

<h2>Blind spots</h2>

<p>Members of the public will have the chance to climb into the bus driver’s seat to experience blind spots and get a view from the bus cab as a cyclist rides past. Cyclists will be able to get high-visibility gear and advice on how to be seen by drivers while blind spot mirrors will be handed out to car drivers.</p>

<h2>Event details</h2>

<p>The event is run by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s road safety team with partners from East Sussex Fire and Rescue and Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company. It will be held at the Old Steine from 10am to 2pm on Tuesday 28 May.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event is part of the council’s ‘Share the Roads, Share the Responsibility’ campaign which aims to reduce the risk of collisions on the city’s roads by raising awareness among different transport users and encouraging people to share the road space.<br />

37691,"<p>Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest dog welfare charity, will be working with officers on patrol in the city to keep any eye out for dogs left in vehicles on streets and in car parks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.&nbsp;Brighton &amp; Hove has been identified as a ‘hot spot’ when it comes to calls received by the RSPCA concerning dogs being left alone in cars over the summer months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s why this year, together with Dogs Trust, the city's Civil Enforcement Officers will be taking action if they spot a dog in distress in a hot car.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If an officer spots a dog in distress they will call 999 so the dog can be removed from the car quickly and safely.</p>

<h1>Raising awareness</h1>

<p>Lee Paris, Senior Campaigns Officer at Dogs Trust, says: “Many people still believe that it's OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm day if the windows are left open or they're parked in the shade, but the truth is, it's not.</p>

<p>“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn't feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in twenty minutes. When it's 22 degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable 47 degrees within the hour.</p>

<p>“We are delighted to be working with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council to raise awareness of the dangers and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Civil Enforcement Officers will report any incidents while carrying out their standard enforcement patrols. This ensures citywide coverage, including council car parks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the environment, transport and sustainability committee,&nbsp;says:&nbsp;“We want people to enjoy the summer months in Brighton &amp; Hove with their dogs, but to keep them safe. Nobody ever thinks it’s going to happen to them or their much loved family pet yet every year many people still gamble with their dog’s life by leaving them alone in a car on a warm day.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
“Working with Dogs Trust we hope to make people aware of the dangers, so that dogs and owners visiting the city return home safely.”</p>

<h1>Caring for dogs in hot weather</h1>

<p>Dogs Trust advise anyone who sees a dog in distress in a hot car to call 999 immediately. Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and unco-ordinated and collapsing.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.<br />

37721,"<p>Local residents and visitors to the city are being encouraged to <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ramblers.org.uk/bbwna"">vote for Brighton &amp; Hove</a>&nbsp;for Britain's Best Walking Neighbourhood Award 2019.</p>

<p>Leader of Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, Councillor Nancy Platts, said:&nbsp;“It is fantastic that our city has been shortlisted for this award, which is recognition of everyone’s valuable work to promote walking as a great way to get around the city. Let’s get voting and sharing on social media to give us the best chance of winning!”</p>

<h2>Making the shortlist</h2>

<p>Announcing the finalists,&nbsp;The Ramblers&nbsp;stated that the city was shortlisted because of its great access to green space and the seafront and specifically the strong community engagement in making its streets lively and full of events, art, things to see and places to go.</p>

<p>The famous seafront promenades and undercliff walks provide 13km of off-road walking for residents and visitors and 40% of the city is within the South Downs National Park. We also boast around <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/leisure-and-libraries/parks-and-green-spaces"">147 parks including heritage parks, playing fields and green spaces</a>. Of our major parks, seven&nbsp;have been awarded Green Flags by the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTCDOFPp3QQ"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<h2>Improving the pedestrian experience</h2>

<p>The Ramblers also recognised Brighton &amp; Hove City Council’s efforts to improve and enhance the pedestrian experience around the city. This includes introducing calm traffic measures and a network of 20mph zones, which means that walkers and cyclists feel much safer to travel&nbsp;around the city centre.</p>

<h2>Shared spaces in the city centre</h2>

<p>The development of New Road, which lies at the heart of the city's cultural hub, has also made it easier to walk from the bustling North Laine shopping area to the Pavilion and onto the famous Palace Pier, just a short walk away.</p>

<p>It was one of the first 'shared space' streets in England where cars are welcome but pedestrians have priority. Creating this shared space has led to a significant reduction in traffic levels, an increase in walkers and more people spending time there for leisure. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>A successful wayfinding system</h2>

<p>Additionally, the city’s successful wayfinding system offers signage and general walking directions around the city and between interchange points, to help people travel around. The signage also directs people to the lesser known areas of the city.</p>

<h2>An award winning Healthwalks scheme</h2>

<p>The council’s <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/leisure-and-libraries/sport-and-activity/healthwalks"">award winning and volunteer-led Healthwalks scheme</a> offers 18 regular walks around the city. Since it was introduced 17&nbsp;years ago, participants have walked over 250,000 miles – the equivalent of walking to the moon and back.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Investing in sustainable, active travel</h2>

<p>Improving people’s health and well-being is also a key objective of our Local Transport Plan, which has ensured continued investment across a range of transport projects that provide for and promote sustainable, active travel.</p>

<p>The next year will see the development of a Local Walking &amp; Cycling Infrastructure Plan to further enhance the city’s offer to pedestrians and cyclists.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Enhancing public spaces</h2>

<p>Major improvement project <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/a-vision-valley-gardens"">Valley Gardens</a>, which is currently under construction, will enhance the public realm in the city centre. Providing widened footways and simplified crossings will make it much easier for pedestrians&nbsp;to travel through a central area of the city, while new paths in the area’s public spaces will make it a much nicer place to walk through.</p>

<h2>Vote for Brighton &amp; Hove&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Every vote counts, so give Brighton &amp; Hove the best chance of winning by encouraging&nbsp;your friends, family, colleagues and&nbsp;neighbours to cast their votes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://mailchi.mp/ramblers.org.uk/bbwna"">Voting is open</a>&nbsp;until 30 June with the winner set to be announced on 10 July.</p>

38091,"<p>To celebrate the many benefits of the bicycle, <a href=""https://www.lovetoride.net/brighton?locale=en-GB"">Love to Ride</a> and <a href=""https://www.cyclinguk.org/"">Cycling UK</a> are inviting people to share their cycling experiences with the #7DaysofCycling hashtag. It’s <a href=""https://www.lovetoride.net/brighton?locale=en-GB"">completely free to take part</a> and everyone is invited to join in. It doesn’t matter if you ride every day or if you haven’t been on a bike in years.</p>

<h2>The benefits of cycling</h2>

<p>People who ride a bike to work are shown to be happier, healthier, wealthier and more productive. Getting more staff cycling to work can benefit employers too by reducing illness and sick leave - with cycle commuters taking half the sick leave of their non-cycling colleagues. Those who ride to work regularly also report improved mental health.</p>

<h2>Supporting the local environment</h2>

<p>Getting more people in the city cycling also helps the local environment by reducing congestion and improving air quality. Congestion and pollution contribute to 40,000 premature deaths annually in the UK and road transport is the main source of emissions in Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<h2>Buying a bike</h2>

<p>Many of the city’s employers, including Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, offer a Cycle to Work Scheme which enables employees to borrow up to £3,000 -&nbsp;tax and National Insurance free -&nbsp;to buy a bike.</p>

<p>The council has partnered with the <a href=""https://greencommuteinitiative.uk/"">Green Commute Initiative</a> (GCI), a social enterprise which offers a flexible bike scheme to staff. Through the scheme, council staff can buy a conventional or electric bike, there is no upper limit on the cost of the bike and a longer period is offered for loan repayments. With GCI, the bike is offered as a tax-free benefit-in-kind by the employer, so that employees don’t have to pay tax on the price of their bike.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Hiring a bike</h2>

<p>For those who don’t want to commit to buying a bike, the <a href=""https://www.btnbikeshare.com/"">BTN BikeShare scheme</a>, which began in September 2017, has over 500 bikes available for hire from hubs across the city.</p>

<p>The pay as you go bike rental costs start at&nbsp;3p per minute, allowing residents and visitors to travel around the city cheaply and sustainably. Since its launch, the scheme has had more than 69,000 users who have made over&nbsp;560,000 journeys, covering more than one million miles.</p>

<h2>Take part</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “The benefits of cycling, which include boosting physical and mental health, are well documented and it is increasingly becoming a more popular way of getting from A to B. It also supports the local environment by reducing congestion and air pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Over the next year, we will be investing further in the city’s cycling infrastructure and developing the city’s cycle network. Our Local Transport Plan outlines plans to provide better surfaces, joined up and marked routes and improvements to the safety and quality of junction crossings for cyclists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I hope many residents are inspired to get back on their bike this week and cycle for fun, health and to commute.”&nbsp;</p>

38776,"<p>A report setting out how major improvement project Valley Gardens will support and facilitate future events in the city, will be presented to the council’s Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee on 25 June.</p>

<h2>New events spaces&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The council’s transport team have worked with event organisers to develop plans for the green spaces at Victoria Gardens where events are traditionally held. New hardscaped areas will be introduced at the Richmond Place/Richmond Terrace junction and the area to the south of St Peter’s Church.</p>

<p>New public spaces will also be created around the Old Steine under plans for Phase 3 of the scheme; all of which will provide new and improved spaces for events to take place.</p>

<p>Improvements&nbsp;include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a new central park with improved footways, lighting and benches throughout&nbsp;</li>
	<li>new public spaces to provide additional capacity for temporary and seasonal events</li>
	<li>access to fresh water and power supplies at Victoria Gardens and Richmond Place</li>
	<li>designated access points for maintenance and event-related vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direct walking and cycling paths</h3>

<p>The overall benefits of the Valley Gardens scheme will also support future events by encouraging people to visit and spend time there. New paths throughout the gardens will provide a continuous route between St Peter’s Place and Church Street/Edward Street junction, while new cycle routes will link key destinations and places in this central part of the city. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Increased&nbsp;biodiversity&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The planting of 152 new trees, grasses and plants will increase the gardens’ biodiversity and reduce the impacts of emissions from transport which affect air quality and climate change.</p>

<h3>Hosting major events</h3>

<p>Valley Gardens is one of the city’s priority events spaces with annual events including Brighton Fringe, the Ladyboys of Bangkok and The Warren, taking place on the site. Other large scale events such as the London to Brighton Bike Ride, the Brighton Marathon and half-Marathon, as well as the city’s annual Pride parade, travel though the Valley Gardens corridor.</p>

<p>Some events are being held at different locations in the city this year while construction works take place but most planned events have largely been accommodated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>A scheme designed with events in mind</h3>

<p>Chair of the Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “We know how important events are to our residents and to the 10 million visitors who visit the city each year. The Valley Gardens scheme has been designed with events in mind and when finished, will offer much improved facilities and new spaces for them to take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“When finished the area with its new green spaces, footpaths, lighting and seating will be a lovely place to spend time. People will be able to travel around the area more easily thanks to improved transport links and designated walking and cycling paths, which will also provide greater access to events.</p>

<p>“We are pleased to have been able to accommodate most events while works are underway and will continue to work closely with organisers to ensure the finished scheme meets their needs.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) aims to improve the walking and cycling network, promote active travel and enhance links between Brighton &amp; Hove and neighbouring areas, including the South Downs National Park.</p>

<h3>Helping us to become carbon neutral by 2030&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Wider benefits of the plan include greater connectivity, equality of opportunity, improved public health and overall quality of life for local residents. It will also help meet the challenge of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2030.</p>

<h3>We want your&nbsp;views</h3>

<p>In February 2019, at the council’s budget meeting, an allocation of £75,000 was approved to support the development of the plan. If given the go ahead on 25 June, transport officers will carry out consultation and engagement so that residents and key stakeholders can give their views on the current walking and cycling network and possible improvements to routes.</p>

<h3>Investing in&nbsp;sustainable, active travel&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Improving people’s health and well-being is a key objective of the council’s Local Transport Plan which has seen continued investment in sustainable, active travel initiatives and projects. Major city centre development project Valley Gardens, which is currently underway, will introduce direct walking and cycling links from The Level to the seafront, making it easier to travel through this central part of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Offering more choice for travelling around the city</h3>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “As we know, road transport is the biggest source of emissions in Brighton &amp; Hove. Encouraging and supporting people to make more of their journeys on foot or by bike, will reduce congestion and improve air quality, while also giving residents more choice about how they travel around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The development of a local cycling and walking plan will support these aims and identify the necessary infrastructure to make it easier for residents and visitors to switch to active travel for their journeys, including shorter journeys within local communities and the city centre.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
","A plan to improve the city's walking and cycling network will be brought before committee on 25 June. The plan aims to improve walking and cycling links in the city as well as enhancing links with neighbouring areas, including the South Downs National Park. ","Transport and roads"
39891,"<p>The council has successfully prosecuted a trader for&nbsp;the fourth time in the last four years, after he failed to apply for a licence to erect scaffolding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The case involved Mr Ben Newton, sole trader of BN Scaffolding. On 1 May 2019, Highway Enforcement officers found scaffolding at 11 St George’s Terrace, Brighton, which obstructed the pavement and had been erected without the necessary permissions.</p>

<p>Mr Newton was contacted and was asked to apply for a licence for the scaffolding by 9 May but failed to do so. As Mr Newton’s company, BN Scaffolding, had been sent three written warnings, the matter was passed on to the council’s legal team for prosecution.&nbsp;After hearing the case, the court found Mr Newton guilty in his absence and fined him £2500, plus costs of £750 and a surcharge of £120 for victim services.</p>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “Mr Newton received ample warning to apply for a licence but failed to do so. Not applying for a licence not only puts the public at risk by obstructing the public highway, it is also unfair to other traders in the city who do things properly and apply for the necessary permissions. This case sends a strong message that we’ll go to court to when we need to, to protect residents and ensure that nobody is put at risk.”</p>

<p>Anyone wanting to use scaffolding on the Public Highway, can <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/roads-and-highways/scaffolding-licence"">apply for a licence online</a>.</p>

40076,"<p>We have held eight free awareness raising sessions for the city’s licensed taxi drivers so they know how to spot the signs of Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) and Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) and how and where to report cases.</p>

<p>Most licensing authorities are now either in the process, or will be shortly, of introducing compulsory safeguarding training for licensed drivers which will be charged to the driver. However, Brighton &amp; Hove City Council has&nbsp;led the way by providing a limited period of training for free available to all licence holders. In total, 563 drivers attended voluntarily over two days.</p>

<p>Exploitation of children and vulnerable adults is a criminal offence and it can happen to any child, young person or vulnerable adult from any background. The process means victims often do not realise that they are being exploited and so it is vital that everyone takes responsibility for identifying people at risk. Reporting can help victims get support and be safeguarded and help bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p>The council worked with the local taxi trade and community organisation YMCA Downslink Group, on the content for the CSE training course.</p>

<p>Chair of the council’s Licensing Committee, Councillor Jackie O’Quinn, said: “Taxi drivers are the eyes and ears of what is happening within our city. Exploitation can be hard to identify and therefore being aware of the signs and acting upon them early can prevent abuse happening or escalating.&nbsp;This course aims to equip the city’s drivers with the necessary skills so they can spot the signs and act quickly to report them. We are pleased to be able to offer this training for free so that all of the city’s licensed taxi drivers have the opportunity to attend.”</p>

40221,"<p>From time to time there is disruption to the city’s transport network while roadworks take place. These works are a necessary part of council-led improvement projects designed to simplify the road layout, upgrade traffic signal systems or carry out vital maintenance work such as repairing potholes and re-surfacing roads.</p>

<p>We also have to allow roadworks to take place to facilitate private developments and utilities works. These are important to ensure the safe and continued supply of water, gas and electricity to homes and businesses.</p>

<p>Over the next few months, there are a high number of works taking place across the city, which could lead to traffic disruption and delays in hot spot areas where significant works are taking place.</p>

<h2>Plan your journey</h2>

<p>We regularly update the <a href=""https://roadworks.org/"">roadworks.org</a> website with information about planned roadworks that we know of in advance. Sometimes we facilitate emergency works at short notice and we add these to the Roadworks website as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Anyone travelling through the city is encouraged to use <a href=""https://roadworks.org/"">roadworks.org</a> for the latest traffic and travel updates.</p>

<h2>Council improvement schemes</h2>

<h3>Valley Gardens</h3>

<p>Construction works are taking place on the roads, pavements and greens spaces that run from St Peter’s Church to Edward Street. This is to support the <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/travel-transport-and-road-safety/a-vision-valley-gardens"">Valley Gardens project</a>, which will see the creation of a new central public park, direct walking and cycling routes and a simplified road layout in this central part of the city.</p>

<p>From mid-August, we will begin the general traffic switch over to the eastern side of Valley Gardens. To manage this transition there will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>no access to general traffic at York Place</li>
	<li>signed diversion at Marlborough Place and North Road</li>
</ul>

<p>Bus routes will be operating as normal through the area. We are working with local residents and businesses situated at York Place and in the surrounding area, to ensure they have access during the works.</p>

<h2>Major city developments</h2>

<h3>Lewes Road</h3>

<p>We are facilitating a number of private developments taking place in the Lewes Road area. The ongoing developments are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.uandiplc.com/our-places/preston-barracks/"">Preston Barracks regeneration scheme</a></li>
	<li>the <a href=""https://www.brighton.ac.uk/bigbuild/index.aspx"">University of Brighton’s ‘Big Build’&nbsp;</a></li>
	<li>Hollingdean Road housing development</li>
</ul>

<p>Construction on these developments is underway. Over the next few months, works will take place to install two new signal junctions and changes to the layout of Lewes Road. These works will impact on general traffic including to cyclists due to lane closures. Buses will also be restricted due to closures of bus lanes. These new developments also need services including gas, water and power and the installing of these supplies may cause additional disruption. This phase of works is expected to be completed by December 2019.</p>

<h3>Hollingdean Road</h3>

<p>A housing development is under construction along Hollingdean Road that is almost at completion. The contractors will soon be dismantling and removing their tower crane from the site. The crane will be dismantled in sections and each section placed on articulated wagons, which will be parked on the road. To facilitate this, Hollingdean Road will need to be closed to traffic between Hughes Road and just north of the railway bridge for two days. The closure is scheduled to take place on Saturday 13 July and Sunday 14 July.</p>

<h2>Facilitating utilities works</h2>

<h3>Montpelier Road</h3>

<p><a href=""https://www.sgn.co.uk/"">Southern Gas Network (SGN)</a> is carrying out works to upgrade the gas network in Montpelier Road to ensure local properties continue to enjoy a safe and reliable gas supply. Engineers are working to replace old metal pipes with new plastic pipe as part of a programme of work developed with the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

<p>SGN are working in six phases along Montpelier Road between its junctions with Western Road and Denmark Terrace. To ensure everyone’s safety, roads are closed around the area as works progress northwards along Montpelier Road. Temporary traffic lights will continue to be installed around the site for safety and to manage traffic flow. Signed diversions are in place for all affected motorists. Works are expected to be completed in November 2019.</p>

<h3>New England Road junction/New England Street</h3>

<p>From Monday 5 August, works will be taking place at New England Street and New England Road to improve traffic signals and the road layout in the area. This work could impact on Preston Circus while temporary signals are in operation but this will be mitigated by the use of new traffic signals that can be connected into the council’s Urban Traffic Control system.</p>

<p>At the same time, Southern Gas Network (SGN) will be carrying out works to replace connection. We are working collaboratively with SGN to carry out both schemes at the same time, sharing cost and shortening duration, to minimise disruption and impact to residents. All works will be completed by the end of September 2019.</p>

40316,"<p>The annual awards which are organised by PATROL (Parking and Traffic Regulations Outside London) recognises the local authorities who have published the best reports on their parking services, as part of their civil enforcement reporting. The best report is judged on the overall presentation, how helpful it is to the local community, the policies, scheme design and the quality of the information provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The award was received on behalf of the council by the Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, and City Transport officers Charles Field, Head of Parking Services and Paul Nicholls, Parking Strategy and Contracts Manager.</p>

<h2>Parking annual report highlights</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/parking/parking-annual-reports"">council’s annual parking report</a> offers an overview of parking in the city, highlighting new initiatives and developing trends, with the continuing aim of improving our services for both residents and visitors. The tenth annual report was published in October 2018 and highlighted a number of major developments that have taken place in the city, including the completion of a large-scale project to replace and upgrade all of the city's pay-and-display ticket machines, with over 800 new solar-powered machines.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Re-investing in city transport</h3>

<p>In 2017/18 the number of Penalty Charge Notices issued fell by 8%, while parking surplus income rose 11% to £15,209,926. Most of our surplus is spent on providing free bus passes for older and disabled people. The rest of the money is re-invested back into other transport projects including highway maintenance such as resurfacing roads and repairing potholes and pavements.</p>

<h3>How we manage&nbsp;parking charges</h3>

<p>Parking charges are used by councils to manage traffic and fairly share out limited road and parking space. While most of the city’s paid parking has for many years remained at £1 per hour, this year new parking charges have been brought in to help manage high-demand times and areas. Charges are set at a higher level in the city centre to reduce demand for on-street parking which helps improve air quality and ease congestion at busy locations. Fees and charges are reviewed annually to ensure they provide value for money.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Congratulations to the parking team</h3>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou said:&nbsp;“We are delighted to receive this internationally recognised award for our work and I would like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to produce the report.&nbsp;The parking annual report is a critical aspect of our civil parking and traffic enforcement work and provides an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value of the city’s publicly operated parking to our residents, in an open and transparent way. We look forward to building on this success and engaging with our residents on the exciting developments planned for this year, including the installation of 200 Electric Vehicle on-street charging points.”</p>
","We've been named as the winner of the Best Report at the Parking Annual Report Awards by Councils event, which was held at the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday 16 July. It is the third time the council has won the award, having previously been successful in 2016 and 2017.","Transport and roads"
40361,"<p>From 1 August a new tariff will be introduced on BTN Bikeshare to help with the cost of running the scheme and ensure its continued success. It is the first time since the bike hire scheme was launched in September 2017 that the cost of hiring a bike has been reviewed.</p>

<h2>Bringing us in line with other bike share schemes</h2>

<p>Introducing a revised tariff structure will bring it in line with similar national and South East schemes. The revised structure will include an unlock fee that overall will better reflect and support the type of trips being made.</p>

<h3>For Pay As You Go customers, the main changes include:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The introduction of a £1 fee to unlock the bike</li>
	<li>A charge of 3p per minute from the first minute</li>
</ul>

<p>There will also be a change to the free daily period for those with annual memberships, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes. This will be for new applicants and will only affect current members when they renew their subscription.</p>

<h3>A key part of our public transport system&nbsp;</h3>

<p>BTN Bikeshare is one of the most successful bike share schemes in the UK. Since launching in 2017, users have made 650,000 trips covering 1.25 million miles. It is popular with both residents and visitors and has 80,000 subscribers and growing daily.</p>

<p>The scheme recently expanded with an additional 120 bikes and more hubs installed in the west of the city and it is now an integral part of the city’s public transport system. In the 2018 COMO UK independent survey of Bikeshare users, 93% of respondents agreed that the bike share scheme has enhanced public transport.</p>

<h3>Investing in sustainable, active travel</h3>

<p>Developing better cycling routes and encouraging the use of the bike share scheme are part of the council’s plan to encourage sustainable, active travel. The development of 38km of cycle lanes has led to a doubling of cycling to work in the city in the last 10 years and continued investment by the council in cycling infrastructure will see the development of a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan over the next year.</p>

<h3>All revenue is invested back into the scheme</h3>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou said: “The BTN Bikeshare scheme has been hugely successful since it was introduced in the city two years ago. Owing to its popularity with residents, the scheme has recently been expanded in the west of the city and in total there are now 570 bikes at 68 hubs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We want to ensure that the scheme can continue to be accessible and enjoyable for everyone. With the expansion of the scheme and its growing popularity, the new tariff rates will help us ensure its continued success and future development.&nbsp;This is the first time since the scheme was launched that we have increased the cost of hiring a bike and all revenue made by the council from the scheme is invested back into it.”&nbsp;<br />

40691,"<p>While a wide range of factors contribute to yearly fluctuations, the long term trend shows continuous improvement overall, with some parts of the designated Air Quality Management Areas now compliant with levels set out in the Government’s Air Quality Strategy (AQS) for England.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/noise-pollution-and-air-quality/air-quality-management-city"">2019 Air Quality Status&nbsp;Report</a> shows that air quality in the city is continuously improving with significant improvement in the Lewes Road Corridor over the past year. The report also highlights that over the long term pollutant levels in the Valley Gardens area are steadily improving.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Air quality management&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is the biggest contributor to poor air quality in the city and largely comes from road transport emissions. For the last year Brighton &amp; Hove City Council is compliant with all pollutants listed in the AQS, with the exception of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).</p>

<p>The city first declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for NO2 in 2004. This included Preston Circus, the Vogue Gyratory and London Road through Valley Gardens to the Pavilion. The two existing AQMAs for NO2 were declared in 2013 and include Brighton &amp; Hove Centre connected with Sackville Road and South Portslade. Rottingdean Village has its own AQMA.</p>

<h3>Investing in sustainable transport</h3>

<p>The council has made great strides to reduce the adverse impacts of transport on its air quality including:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>the introduction of an Ultra Low Emission Zone for buses covering North Street</li>
	<li>securing significant levels of funding to retro-fit the city’s bus fleet supporting further progress towards Ultra Low emission vehicles</li>
	<li>investing in electric vehicle infrastructure which will see 200 electric vehicle charging points installed in residential areas this year and the development of electric hubs with rapid charging facilities for taxis</li>
	<li>developing cycling and walking infrastructure, creating 38km of cycle lanes and providing better connected cycling and walking routes through the city centre</li>
	<li>displaying signage across the city centre to discourage engine idling at key junctions and taxi ranks</li>
	<li>working with schools to raise awareness and encourage behavioural change to the use of sustainable travel by children and their carers’ and to prevent idling outside school gates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Putting health and wellbeing first</h3>

<p>Health and wellbeing is a key objective of the council’s Local Transport Plan which has seen continued investment in sustainable active travel.&nbsp;The promotion of active travel provides people with alternative travel options for some journeys, especially short ones, which can help avoid emissions where many live. Brighton &amp; Hove is one of the UK’s least car dependent cities and one third of city residents do not own a car. In the central AQMA this rises to two thirds. Nearly twice as many people walk to work compared with the rest of the UK while bus use is the highest in the country outside of London.</p>

<h3>Urgently addressing climate change</h3>

<p>The council has declared a climate emergency and is seeking to significantly reduce its carbon impacts by 2030 and build resilience against the effects of climate change. No emission travel is a key component to helping us achieve this.</p>

<h3>Developing a sustainable Local Transport Plan</h3>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “It is encouraging to see that air quality in some parts of the city is improving and over the long term there have been consistent reductions in pollution levels. We have been working hard to reduce emissions by investing in sustainable travel and public transport, developing electric vehicle infrastructure and encouraging behavioural change.</p>

<p>“However, we can’t afford to be complacent and as this report reminds us, the biggest contributor to poor air quality in our city comes from road traffic emissions. The health and wellbeing of our residents is paramount, as is protecting the local environment and mitigating the impacts of climate change as a matter of urgency. Further reductions in vehicle emissions, particularly nitrogen dioxide, are therefore essential if we are to improve the city’s air quality.</p>

<p>“Over the coming year, as we develop the next Local Transport Plan, we will be exploring options to progress these measures further including reviewing traffic movement in the city centre, developing a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan and moving ahead with key developments including Valley Gardens.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How you can help improve air quality</h3>

<p>There are lots of ways residents can help to improve the city’s air for everyone. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your car time off; walk, cycle or scooter to school, work and leisure</li>
	<li>Use public transport. The city’s bus fleet is investing in cleaner buses every year and new trains will use less electricity</li>
	<li>Go electric. This year we’re installing 200 electric vehicle charging points across the city, making it easier to recharge an electric car or van. Consider switching to electric today.</li>
	<li>Don’t idle your engine. If you do have to drive, you can help by turning off your engine when your vehicle is stationary and it is safe to do so</li>
	<li>Don’t park in the vicinity of the school gates. If driving your child is the only option, why not park a little way from the school? You could also start to car share which will save money on fuel, while also reducing emissions and congestion outside schools at peak times.</li>
	<li>Use clean home heating without burning coal or wood in open fireplaces; consider replacing of old boilers for ground or air source heat pumps</li>
</ul>
","We've published our Air Quality Annual Status Report showing that air quality in the city is continuously improving, with significant improvement in the Lewes Road corridor over the past year. The report also highlights that pollutant levels in the Valley Gardens area are steadily improving.","Transport and roads"
40896,"<p>From this autumn we’ll be installing flood doors, bricks or gates in homes in Carden Avenue, Dale Drive and Warmdene Road to reduce their risk of flooding.</p>

<p>We’ve secured £240,000 for the work, which follows a similar scheme in Hove and Portslade last year.</p>

<p>Residents living in properties that could be at risk of surface-water flooding will be offered flood doors, gates or automatic air brick covers that automatically shut out water when heavy rain threatens to cause flooding to properties.</p>

<h1>Practical support</h1>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the city’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “As extreme weather events become more common we have been actively exploring ways to offer protection for people’s homes that are most at risk from surface-water flooding. These incidents can happen very suddenly and we’re pleased to be able to offer practical support for residents as well as be committed to taking action on a wider scale to reduce the impact of climate change.”</p>

<p>Since 2000 residents in Carden Avenue, Warmdene Road and Dale Drive have experienced repeated instances of flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. During the summers of 2014 and 2015 heavy rainfall caused more than 100 properties throughout the &nbsp;city to flood as sewers and drains were unable to cope.</p>

<h1>How the scheme works</h1>

<p>We’re currently arranging for surveys in vulnerable properties that have flooded internally to find out what would work best in each home. The scheme is completely voluntary and will be completed in consultation with the residents.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What we are doing</h1>

40901,"<p>People with non-physical (‘hidden’) disabilities will soon be able to apply for a Blue Badge for parking, following the introduction of new criteria from the Department for Transport.</p>

<p>From 30 August, drivers or passengers with less visible disabilities, such as dementia or anxiety disorders will be able to apply for a Blue Badge alongside applicants who have very considerable difficulty walking.</p>

<p>The aim of the scheme is to help disabled people access goods and services, by allowing them to park closer to their destination.</p>

<h2>Enhancing lives</h2>

<p>The new extended criteria marks a big change to the Blue Badge scheme following an extensive independent programme of work undertaken on behalf of the Department for Transport.</p>

<p>The changes are designed to enhance the lives of people whose non-physical disabilities make travelling by road difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Brighton &amp; Hove City Council supports the extension of Blue Badges to people with non-physical disabilities and took part in the government’s consultation in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Council officers, who have already started preparing for the new applications, include an expert assessor who will make recommendations for people&nbsp;who are not automatically entitled to a Blue Badge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Assessments will be made on a ‘case by case’ basis following&nbsp;Department for Transport guidance.</p>

<h2>Tackling misuse</h2>

<p>The expanded scheme also includes a new task force to help councils tackle fraudulent use of the badges.</p>

<p>The scheme also aims to increase public awareness of which groups are eligible for Blue Badges, when they can and cannot be used, and how to surrender badges when they are no longer needed, for example if the badge holder dies.</p>

<h2>More independence</h2>

<p>Councillor Anne Pissaridou, chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee said: ""This change to Blue Badge guidance has the potential to make a real difference to the lives of residents with hidden disabilities, enabling them &nbsp;to travel with greater ease and live more independent lives.”</p>

40976,"<p>The next critical stage of works on the Valley Gardens project will take place from next week (Monday 2 September), when we will begin the switchover of general traffic to the eastern side of the gardens. This will allow shared spaces to be constructed on the western side, to provide:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a new consistent bus and taxi lane</li>
	<li>two cycle routes that will provide access to businesses and residential areas&nbsp;</li>
	<li>wider pavements&nbsp;which will provide greater scope for cafes, bars and restaurants to have outdoor seating areas</li>
</ul>

<h2>No access to general traffic at York Place</h2>

<p>In preparation for the switchover of general traffic, there will be no access to general traffic at York Place. Signed diversions are in place at the exit points at North Road and Marlborough Place to ensure drivers are aware of diversion routes when travelling around the area.</p>

<p>Buses will continue to operate as normal throughout the area and we are working with residents and businesses to ensure access throughout the works.</p>

<p>In the final scheme, private traffic will be able to access the new western bus and taxi corridor but will be prevented from travelling all the way along Valley Gardens on the western side.</p>

<h2>A new traffic system in the city centre</h2>

<p>The switchover of general traffic will simplify and improve the movement of traffic, by moving buses, taxis and local access onto a consistent route that will run along the western side of Valley Gardens, and keep private vehicles on the eastern side.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Creating more public space and improved crossings</h2>

<p>By creating a new road layout, we will be able to reclaim some of the public space, which is currently given over to vehicles. This will enable us to install new crossings throughout the area, including widened pavements&nbsp;and new paths across the central green spaces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Works are already underway to provide simple, direct and consistent cycle routes on both sides of the gardens. The two quieter cycle routes on the western side will be in addition to the dedicated cycle lane along the eastern side of the gardens.</p>

<h2>Keeping the city moving&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “Works on the Valley Gardens project&nbsp;are at an important stage, which will see one of the major improvements take place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The switchover of general traffic to the eastern side of the gardens will enable works to progress on the western side to create shared space for dedicated cycle lanes, wider footways and more access to public space. Changing the traffic routes around the gardens will also open up a new central park for residents and visitors to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We have worked closely with the contractors to develop traffic management plans in order to ensure minimal disruption to residents and visitors. As with any major project, there may be some temporary disruption and we thank everyone for their patience while these works take place.”</p>
","A critical stage of work on the Valley Gardens project starts on Monday 2 September, when all general traffic will move to the eastern side of the gardens, allowing work to start on shared spaces on the western side.

41116,"<p>Situated in the heart of the city, the historic Old Steine was once a place where residents and visitors would flock to - famous for its promenade, open green space and the ornate Victoria Fountain.</p>

<h2>Creating sustainable transport links</h2>

<p>Over the years, the development of well-intentioned traffic infrastructure has led to the area being segregated and harder to access. The encircling road has closed off the green spaces and invited more traffic, causing congestion and increasing air pollution. The introduction of a series of junctions and gyratories has made walking and cycling through the area difficult and unpleasant. The Valley Gardens project is designed to address this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Zero carbon&nbsp;by 2030</h3>

<p>Overall the finished scheme will bring two key outcomes. Firstly, it will form a vital part of our move to become a carbon neutral city by 2030 through investment in a sustainable transport network that supports walking, cycling, and public transport. Secondly, it will give public space back to the local community, allowing the city’s residents and visitors the opportunity to enjoy this area of our city once more.</p>

<h3>A new central park</h3>

<p>Phases 1 &amp; 2 of the scheme are now well underway, with significant changes already made to improve the road layout and open spaces from St Peter’s Church to Edward Street and introduce new paths for cycling and walking. Works to create a central park will soon follow, including the planting of more than 150 trees, which will improve the environment and air quality. Phase 3, which focuses on the area from the Old Steine to the Palace Pier, is a continuation of this work and it is vital to achieving the overall aims for the area, including coordinated sustainable transport links and open public spaces through the city centre and down to the sea.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Opening up key city landmarks</h3>

<p>While the current area has become a transitory route for visitors and residents, the completed scheme will open up key city landmarks, including the iconic Royal Pavilion and the vibrant Kemp Town area in the east of the city. The Pavilion Gardens, one of the most popular and well-loved green spaces in the city, has been listed as at risk by Historic England. Creating an open public space in front of the gardens and distance away from road traffic, will protect and preserve the gardens into the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Valuing our public space</h3>

<p>The Valley Gardens project has always been about changing the very nature of how we access, use and value this public space at the heart of our city. Input from the local community is therefore vital in shaping the design for the area and it is my intention that this engagement continues in the final detailed design stage. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Future-proofing the city&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly, things will change as the design is worked on but the overall vision for the area and core objectives will not be changed and I make no apologies for that. If we are serious about addressing climate change, improving air quality and future-proofing the city for the years to come, then we must be bold in our vision and we must act now.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Improving the local environment</h3>

<p>As an administration, we have to implement the changes that will bring the biggest overall benefits to the most people. That does mean moving away from car usage in the city centre to improve air quality, it does mean creating more green space to protect the local environment and it does mean creating more public space to enhance the landmarks that draw people to the city, including the Royal Pavilion and the seafront.</p>

<h3>Realising the area's full potential&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Once completed, the Valley Gardens scheme will help to realise the full potential of the area, by giving the community access to public space, while providing the infrastructure needed to meet the pace and scale of the environmental challenges of the day. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s not waste this significant opportunity and pressing need to move towards a more sustainable city for our citizens today and for future generations.</p>

41131,"<p>The 16 September marks the start of European Mobility Week, a week long campaign to promote sustainable, active travel and invite people to try alternatives to car use.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Safe walking and cycling</h2>

<p>We’ll be taking part in this year’s mobility week and the theme of Safe Walking and Cycling by encouraging residents to use sustainable, active travel to make their journeys around the city. The final day of the campaign is Car Free Day (22 September) and we encourage residents and visitors to the city to leave the car at home on this day and travel to the city using public transport, cycling or walking.</p>

<h2>Working together to improve air quality</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “We know that transport emissions are the biggest contributor to air pollution in Brighton &amp; Hove and we are taking a number of steps to reduce emissions, improve air quality and to help us meet our goal of becoming a zero carbon city by 2030. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“The council cannot deliver significant change by itself and working with transport partners and stakeholders is vital to help tackle the issue of air pollution and deliver lower emission transport options, sooner.</p>

<p>“Residents can also help by making more journeys by bike, on foot or using public transport. Not only will this help improve air quality and protect our environment, it has been shown to boost physical and mental health and could save you money on travel.”</p>

<h2>The time to act is now</h2>

<p>The council has declared a climate emergency and has committed to becoming a zero carbon city by 2030. Investing in sustainable travel is critical to helping us achieve this. This Mobility Week, we’re highlighting some of the steps we’re taking to meet this goal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Our Top 20</h2>

<ol>
	<li>We’ve introduced an Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) for buses covering Castle Street, North Street and parts of Western Road. The aim of the ULEZ is to improve air quality by reducing levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in areas of the city where it has remained above European and English legal limits</li>
	<li>We have secured significant levels of funding to retro-fit the city’s bus fleet with exhausts which provide substantially lower oxide of nitrogen emissions. New cleaner vehicles to be rolled out in the next year including hybrid and electric buses</li>
	<li>We’re investing in infrastructure. In September 2018 works started on Valley Gardens, a major transport project which will provide new direct cycle lanes and walking paths through the city centre, as well as a central park and more public space&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We’re developing a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan to provide better connected cycling and walking routes across the city and to neighbouring areas</li>
	<li>We’re investing in Electric Vehicle infrastructure. This year we’re rolling out 200 electric vehicle charging points in residential areas and developing electric hubs with rapid charging facilities for taxis, making it easier to switch to electric</li>
	<li>We made health and wellbeing a key objective of our Local Transport Plan. In Autumn 2019 we’ll be consulting on the city’s next Local Sustainable Transport Plan, which will focus on reducing carbon emissions, health and wellbeing and improving quality of life</li>
	<li>Our bike share scheme is one of the most successful in the country and has been shortlisted for two National Transport Awards. This year we expanded it to the west of the city, adding an extra 120 bikes to the fleet</li>
	<li>We’ve added more anti-idling signs around the city at key junctions and taxi ranks to prevent idling and encourage engine switch off&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We’re working with our partners Sustrans on the School Streets project, to raise awareness of air pollution outside schools caused by idling vehicles and to encourage behavioural change by children and their carers’ to make the journey school using sustainable travel</li>
	<li>We bid for Government funding where we can to support sustainable travel initiatives. We’ve just won more grant funding for Bikeability, which helps us deliver cycle training to 4 to 14 year old children in the city</li>
	<li>Through our Access Fund, we have partnered with Love to Ride for Cycle September, a workplace challenge to get more people cycling to work. Over 90 city workplaces have signed up for the challenge in September 2019</li>
	<li>Through our electric bike project, we’re working with local workplaces to encourage staff take up of electric bikes, which can help overcome barriers to cycling and encourage more people to use sustainable transport for commuting</li>

41196,"<p>The&nbsp;council has welcomed proposals to clampdown on thoughtless drivers who park on pavements.</p>

<p>At present, it’s only illegal to park on pavements in London, with those caught being hit with a £75 fine.</p>

<p>But with the problem escalating in Brighton &amp; Hove, and the number of complaints rising, the&nbsp;council has thrown its weight behind the plans to force the government into action.</p>

<h2>Government ‘failing to act’</h2>

<p>The all-party Commons’ Transport Committee has called on the Government to ban pavement parking across the UK saying it’s ‘deeply concerned about the government’s failure to act’.</p>

<p>The committee has produced a damning report which includes written evidence from the&nbsp;council on the problems Brighton &amp; Hove faces. The report states that some drivers may get confused about the different rules and regulations.</p>

<h2>Council needs the powers to take action</h2>

<p>Paul Nicholls, the council’s Parking Strategy and Contract Manager and PATROL (Parking and Traffic Regulations Outside London) Advisory Board Member, who wrote the evidence states: “Pavement parking has been a long running issue in Brighton &amp; Hove, which we have been unable to resolve with the enforcement powers currently available to us.</p>

<h2>“Pavements must be made safe for pedestrians”</h2>

<p>Mr Nicholls added: “If we’re given the powers to take enforcement action against pavement parking, we can make the rules and restrictions clear for everyone to ensure pavements aren’t blocked and pedestrians are safe.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ian Taylor, from the Alliance of British Drivers (ABD), states in the report that the majority of his members are aware of the rules but “as regards practice, and what people think they can get away with...people tend to do it.”</p>

<h2>Ban is “long overdue”</h2>

<p>Cllr Anne Pissaridou, chair of the council’s environment, transport and sustainability committee, said: “Banning drivers from parking on our pavements is something that’s very long overdue.</p>

<p>“People that park on our footpaths have absolutely no regards or respect for anyone but themselves. They think nothing of blocking the pavement which makes it both hazardous and dangerous for pedestrians, but especially for people who are visually impaired, wheelchair users, people with children’s buggies and those in disabled mobility scooters.”</p>

<h2>Pavement parkers know the impact on pedestrians, but do it anyway</h2>

<p>A 2017 YouGov survey, commissioned by charity Guide Dogs UK, found 55% of drivers had considered the impact of pavement parking on people with visual impairments but did it regardless.</p>

<p>The London ban has been in place since 1974, but consecutive governments have failed to give local authorities the powers in any other part of the country – including Brighton &amp; Hove.</p>

<p>Cllr Pissaridou added: “Despite the council receiving many complaints about these thoughtless drivers, there is nothing we can do about it.</p>

<p>“Now, hopefully the government will listen to the transport committee and give us, and every local authority in the UK, the powers to take action against these drivers.”</p>

41206,"<p>One year ago, works started on Valley Gardens, a major project which aims to improve the transport network and public realm in the centre of Brighton.</p>

<p>Work is&nbsp;currently underway on Phases 1 &amp; 2 of the project, which&nbsp;focuses on the area from St Peter’s Church to Edward Street.</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VE8ab-wUBoo"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<h2>A new traffic system</h2>

<p>The switchover of general traffic to the eastern side of the gardens took place earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new system aims to simplify and improve the movement of traffic&nbsp;by moving buses, taxis and local access traffic on to a consistent route that will run along the western side of Valley Gardens, while keeping private vehicles on the eastern side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has also enabled work&nbsp;to progress on the western side to create shared space for dedicated cycle lanes, wider footways and more access to public space.</p>

<h2>Improved transport links and a new central park</h2>

<p>Since work&nbsp;began in September 2019, significant changes have been made to simplify the road layout in the area and create new cycling and walking paths and widened pavements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Work&nbsp;to create a central park is also underway. The green spaces that run through the area will be landscaped and more than 150 trees will be planted, improving the environment and air quality.</p>

<p>The area has remained open to traffic throughout, with traffic management plans in place aimed at minimising disruption to everyone travelling through the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bus routes have continued to operate as normal and the project team have worked with businesses in the area to ensure continued access and to facilitate deliveries.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Giving public&nbsp;space back to the community</h2>

<p>Chair of the Environment, Transport and Sustainability Committee, Councillor Anne Pissaridou, said: “Overall, the finished Valley Gardens scheme will bring two key outcomes.</p>

<p>""Firstly, it will form a vital part of our move to become a carbon neutral city by 2030 through investment in a sustainable transport network that supports walking, cycling, and public transport.</p>

<p>""Secondly, it will give public space back to the local community, allowing the city’s residents and visitors the opportunity to enjoy this area of our city once more.</p>

<p>“Valley Gardens Phase 3 is a continuation of the work that has already begun and it is vital to achieving the overall aims for the area, including coordinated sustainable transport links and open public spaces through the city centre and down to the sea.”</p>

<h2>Minimising disruption to buses</h2>

<p>Martin Harris, Managing Director of Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company, said: “Valley Gardens Phases 1 &amp; 2 have gone very smoothly so far. We’ve had great co-operation with the council, the planners, the contractors and it has been a good team effort to ensure we minimise disruption to bus services during the construction phases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Overall I think it’s a really positive scheme for the city, it’s going to introduce a lot of great space for people to use and make the whole centre of the city more attractive.</p>

<p>""Obviously to achieve that, there has needed to be changes to traffic flows and that brings challenges for bus services and our passengers, but we’re very encouraged by how things have gone with Phases 1 &amp; 2 and we look forward to Phase 3 continuing in that vein.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’ve been pleased by the development of the Phase 3 plan, from the original concept to the current design.</p>

<p>""It’s a framework that we’re very happy to support, we believe it will deliver not only the improved public space around the Old Steine area and the Palace Pier, but also provides the opportunity to significantly improve the waiting environment for bus passengers in the Old Steine area.”</p>
